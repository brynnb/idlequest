### Installing the Game

Insert the first EverQuest Trilogy CD into your CD-ROM drive. The installation should begin on its own within a minute. If it does not, you can start the installation by opening My Computer, double-clicking on your CD-ROM drive, then finally double-clicking the EverQuest Trilogy icon. Follow the instructions within the setup program to complete the installation. After the game is fully installed, an EverQuest shortcut will be added to your desktop and Start menu.

### Starting the Game

In order to play, you must first set up an EverQuest account. To do this, do the following:

1. Connect to the Internet
2. Double left click on EverQuest.exe, or double left click on an EverQuest shortcut on your desktop or taskbar (if you have one). This connects to the EverQuest login server and downloads any additional files that have been either changed or added. When you do this for the first time, it is normal to get many files added to what was installed from the EverQuest CD.
3. Click **Play Online** on the patcher program, after it is done downloading any files.
4. Left Click on **Account**, then click on **New Account**, to register and set up a name and password for your new account. You will need your CD Key here to set up the account.
5. Choose a password that NO ONE will know. Account security is the responsibility of the account holder. Please note EverQuest accounts are not to be shared. Each family member is to have their own account. The exception to this is for parents to purchase an account for a child. Please refer to the End User License Agreement which you click I Accept to, every time you play EverQuest, for a detailed description of policies regarding account sharing. Please be sure to let us know if your email address changes in the future by changing your account information from www.station.sony.com if it happens to change due to switching ISPs, etc.
6. Click on **Change Account** to set up a billing option. You will need a credit card to do this.
7. Click on **Connect** to start the game.
8. Select a server, then click **Play EverQuest**. Please refer to the EQManual_Supplement.doc or .txt in your EverQuest folder for a description of our different server types.
9. Click on **Create new character**. At this point, you will be required to choose a race, class and deity. You will also need to invest your ability points into your attributes. The recommended attributes to add to are colored green. It is suggested that players do some research before creating their first character.
10. Before your character is done, you need to choose a name. It is strongly suggested you read the EverQuest naming policy before choosing a name. In order to protect our role playing environment, the naming policy is necessary. Please refer to the naming policy at www.EverQuest.com before selecting a name for your character. Also, you can choose to click on **Get Name** for our random name generator to suggest some names you might like. Be aware that some of these names have been taken by other players. So you may not get a random name approved every time.
11. Once you have chosen a name, you may or may not be able to change your starting city. After a deity and starting city has been determined, click **Enter World** to start the game.

### Arriving in Norrath

You begin the game in your starting city with these items. (Press `I`, then click Inventory to view them).

- 5 Bread cakes and 5 skins of milk
- Spells (for some classes)
- Standard weapon (dagger, sword, or club)
- Scroll with instructions (a tattered note: right click on the scroll to read it)
- Tome of Order and Discord

The Tome of Order and Discord is for those players who choose the way of chaos. Once the Tome of Order and Discord has been turned into the Priest of Discord, that character is now player vs. player flagged and can attack other players that have also chosen the ways of chaos. It is suggested that only well experienced and seasoned players choose this path, as it is very limiting in that you can not receive beneficial spells from those that have not chosen the same path. For those players that are interested in player vs. player battles, there are servers specifically with that in mind. Please refer to EQManual_Supplement.doc or .txt in your EverQuest folder on your hard drive.

Next, carry your message scroll to your Guild Master. He or she will then give you a basic item of clothing and more information about what to do next. Press `I` and click on the clothing item to pick it up, then click on the picture of your character in the upper right part of your Inventory screen in order to wear it. The pictured area of your inventory screen is an auto equip area. Dropping an item into the auto equip area will equip the item. This is provided there is nothing in the slot the item goes in, and your class, race, and deity can wear or use it. If the item can not be worn, it will automatically go to one of the main inventory slots. If those are full, the item will go into the first container in the upper left most spot. If all main inventory slots and containers are full, the item will drop to the ground. Be aware that some merchants are greedy and might pick up items they see lying on the ground. This also can be said about other players as well.

### Moving Around

To move around, use the arrow keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→` | Move forward/backward and turn left/right |
| `Num Lock` | Press to run, or click Run on the interface |

Some other useful movement keys are:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl` + `←`, `→` | Step sideways |
| `Spacebar` | Jump |
| `C` | Duck down |

### Looking Around

Use the mouse or Numpad keys to change your current point of view:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Right-click-and-drag mouse | Pan view (use `F12` to toggle mouse panning) |
| `Alt` + `←`, `→`, `↑`, `↓` | Pan view |
| Numpad `8`, `2` | Pan view up, down |
| Numpad `5` | Re-center view |
| Numpad `+`, `-` | Zoom view in, out |

### Communicating

To send messages to characters around you:
- Press `Enter`, type your message, then press `Enter` again to send it.

To talk to a non-player character (such as a shopkeeper NPC):
- "Hail" the NPC by left-clicking and typing `H`.

### Attacking With Weapons

Combat in towns is not suggested. Merchants most likely will be much stronger than your character starts out being. Getting away from the cities, one will find creatures of appropriate difficulty. Make sure you loot the corpses of your kills to sell the items for some well needed currency.

**Before making an attack:**
1. (If applicable) Program any combat skills onto Hot buttons.
2. Open your inventory (press `I`) and click on your weapon.
3. Click on the picture of your character to put it in hand. (Do this again only when you want to change the weapon you're holding.)
4. Press `I` again or click Done.

**To make an attack:**
1. Move near your intended target and click on it.
2. Press the auto-attack key (`A` is the default). (Or if you possess combat skills, click Combat, then any attack button.)

Once you've killed something, you can loot its corpse:
1. Right-click on the corpse, then click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It "floats" on your cursor.
2. Click on a free slot in your inventory.

If you die, you can loot your own corpse - if you can locate your old body.

### Using Magic

Some occupations start out with one or more spells. To learn (scribe and memorize) a spell:

1. Click **Spells**.
2. Click on a spell scroll in your inventory. (Right-click on a scroll first to view its contents.)
3. Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe (write) the spell.

Scribed spells are permanently recorded in your spell book.

4. Once it's scribed, click on the spell icon in your spell book.
5. A rock-colored spell gem appears on your cursor.
6. Click on an oval slot to the left of the book to memorize the spell. (You can store up to 8 spells at one time in gem slots.)

**To cast a spell:**
1. Click on a target. (Spells that affect only you don't require a target.)
2. Click on a spell gem (oval slot).
3. Wait for your blue mana bar to return to normal, then cast again.

### Quick Cash

When you start, you've got enough food and drink to last for about 5 game days (about 30 real-time hours).

To buy more, you need money. Here are some suggestions:

**Beg.** Add the Beg ability to a Macro button and practice that skill by targeting non-player characters and clicking Beg. Be aware that begging is a risky venture. Merchants may get tired of your begging and attack your character.

**Kill small game.** Go into the wilderness (but not too far) and practice attacking rats, snakes, bats and other small game. Loot their corpses and sell any items you find to merchants.

**Cast spells.** If you start out with a useful spell (for instance, Minor Healing for clerics), stand near the city gates and offer to cast it for donations from fellow players. (Some spells are known naturally. For others, you must scribe a spell scroll from your inventory.)

**Currency conversion:**
- 1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 silver = 1000 copper

### Skills

Your character possesses a few basic skills at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense Heading and Bind Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally known to those of a specific race or occupation, while others that you don't originally know can be learned (such as swimming).

**Program a skill onto a Macro button as follows:**
1. Click **Abilities**, then right-click on a Macro button.
2. Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.
3. Click that Macro button to use the skill.

Click **Persona** and click **Skills** (if not already selected) to see how proficient you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better you become at it. When you do improve, messages appear in your text display.

### Experience

You start out at Experience Level 1 in whatever occupation you choose. As you gain experience through combat, you progress to the next level.

Click **Persona** and click **Stats** (if not already selected) to view your current level and how much experience you need to advance to the next level. To gain experience, find your guild, kill creatures and complete quests.

### Acquiring, Selling and Buying Items

**To loot the corpse of a monster or player you've killed:**
1. Right-click on the corpse. You can only loot a corpse if the damage you and/or your group did was greater than anyone else. Players can only loot the corpses of other players if they play on a PvP server (player vs. player) and if they get the killing blow. Or, when a player who has turned in their tome to the Priest of Discord kills a player that has also turned in their tome on a regular server, they can loot the player's corpse. Please refer to the EQManual_Supplement.doc or .txt in your EverQuest folder you installed EverQuest to for a complete listing of looting rules on the differing PvP servers, as some servers have item loot and others only coin loot.
2. Click on an item in the corpse's inventory (it "floats" on your cursor).
3. Click on a free slot in your inventory.

**To buy/sell an item:**
1. Right-click on a merchant NPC.
2. Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it.
3. Click **Purchase** or **Sell** (use the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling multiple items).

**To give away/drop/destroy an item:**
1. Open your inventory (`I`).
2. Click on the item (it "floats" on the cursor).
3. To drop it, click anywhere in your front view.
4. To give it to someone, click on that person and click **Give**.
5. To destroy something you can't give away or drop, click **Destroy**.

**If you accidentally drop an item, you can pick it up:**
1. Double-click on the item (it appears as a small bag on the ground).
2. Click in an open inventory slot.

### Programming Hot Buttons

To copy any Macro button or interface button onto a Hot button slot:
1. Click-and-hold on any button. A copy appears on your cursor.
2. Click on the blank Hot button.

### Exiting the Game

To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Click **SIT** on the Main button set, then **CAMP**. (This takes approximately 30 seconds.) Then, click **Exit**.

> **Tip:** If you die, try not to quit the game before you find your corpse and recover any valuable items.

## 2 • The History of Norrath

### A Weary Traveler's Journal

*My companions, warriors and members of Evil's Bane, are sleeping close by as I write. It is our first night on blessedly dry land after a long sea journey. Only a sputtering candle lights this darkened common room of the first inn by the docks in Firiona Vie, as a fresh quill scratches my words on the parchment. We've all sailed a long way from Antonica, following the trail of stories and rumors about an unusual winged beast that swooped down during a battle and carried off Lysel - our sworn companion and the Bane's best swordswoman - in its hooked talons.*

*Weeks ago, we were about to give up the search when Rallos Zek intervened and sent us a spark of hope in the form of a tall, cloaked visitor. He told us that he had heard of others being captured by flying creatures, and he told us we needed to forget about our friend - that she had been taken as a slave to the Ring of Scale on "Kunark," and that no slave has ever escaped.*

*None of us had ever been to this place, Kunark, but we were encouraged by the fact that Lysel might still be alive. We all agreed. If there was a chance that she lived, there was a chance we could rescue her. Our mysterious friend only shook his head. Then, he slipped back the hood of his cloak so that we might see his reptilian face. He introduced himself as Vanusk and told us he was boarding the Seahawk that evening to sail to Kunark. In return for our companionship on the long voyage, and payment of his passage, Vanusk offered to tell us about his homeland. His tales included much that we already knew. However, so that I would miss nothing, I recorded everything he said.*

#### In the Beginning...

There always has been and always will be an entity known as The Nameless. The universe and its countless suns and worlds sprang from the will of the Nameless, as well as many powerful creatures whom one might call gods. Whereas The Nameless created the stage, these gods gave birth to us, the many actors upon that stage.

#### Dragons First - The Age of Scale

**Veeshan**, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky, was the first god to notice the world of Norrath. She found it pleasing and deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. Dragons walked the land and flew the skies - powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength.

#### Early Gods and Their Interventions - The Elder Age

In time, another god noticed Veeshan's work. **Brell Serilis**, the Duke of Underfoot, secretly created a magic portal to a cavern deep in the belly of Norrath. Through this portal, he seeded the depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures and sealed them within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living Stone.

With his own supplicants in place, Brell Serilis then discussed the fate of Norrath with the other gods: **Tunare** the Great Mother, **Prexus** the Oceanlord, and **Rallos Zek** the Warlord. With words befitting the King of Thieves, Brell proposed that they accept an alliance of sorts, to divide the planet amongst them for the purpose of keeping the Dragon Wurmqueen in check. All agreed to the division; however, Rallos Zek pledged his allegiance to none.

Thus, the gods each created a race of beings to keep a vigilant eye on Norrath and the schemes of Dragonkind:
- **Brell Serilis** forged the **Dwarves**, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains.
- **Prexus** the Oceanlord produced his children, the **Kedge**, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina.
- Aboveground, **Tunare** the Great Mother gave birth to the **Elves**, creatures of limitless grace and beauty.
- **Rallos Zek** created the **Giants**, a race of fierce and formidable surface-dwellers, ever intent upon the defense of their lands.

#### Unwanted Attention - The Age of Monuments

**Innoruuk**, The Prince of Hate, cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed they would regret such disrespect. He took the first Elven King and Queen and slowly tore them apart physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic image. These Dark Elven creatures came to be known as the **Teir'Dal**.

**Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane** and **Cazic-Thule** came next to Norrath. Brell Serilis entered into a second pact with these gods, along with Rallos Zek.

From this pact:
- **Brell** added the **Gnomes** - cousins to Dwarves, yet more wiry, gnarled and consumed by tinkering with devices.
- **Rallos Zek** made the **Ogres** - massive, implacable beings of questionable intelligence - and the **Orcs**, bred for battle and single-minded in their desire for conquest.
- On the surface, away from Elves and Giants, **Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane** fashioned the **Halflings**, a short and stubby folk, who were nonetheless agile and had a distinct propensity to meddle (or even pilfer) at times.
- **Cazic-Thule**, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and there created the green-skinned **Trolls** and the reptilian **Iksar** of Kunark.

#### Fall of Rallos Zek and His Children

Only the Ogres of Rallos Zek dared invade the Plane of Earth itself. Through a combined offensive effort, the other gods finally defeated and imprisoned Rallos Zek in his own domain, the Planes of Power. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. Rallos Zek's third race, the Goblins, were also cursed, although no writings remain of their trials.

#### End of Elven Prosperity

The Elddar Forest, the Elven realm of old, spread across the entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Tree communities as well as cities of marble and gleaming snow-white spires rose out of the forest, higher than the tallest trees. This prosperity drew the jealousy of **Solusek Ro**, Lord of Flame. The rivers ran dry, and less rain fell. The great Elven druids fought long and hard with their powerful magic, attempting to turn back the change, but they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, until at last even the fair Elven city Takish-Hiz crumbled, and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much of their greatness behind.

#### Birth of Humankind - The Age of Blood

As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. These were twin deities **Mithaniel Marr**, God of Valor, and his sister **Erollisi**, Goddess of Love. Their creatures, the **Barbarians**, proved a hardy race and settled the cold and rugged northlands near the ruins of the Giants' empire. As the Barbarians spread out across the lands - in dispute with each other and any other race encountered - a tiny movement toward enlightened thinking was sparked by the Twins Marr and began slowly to grow. And so, even amidst desolation and war, there was hope.

This enlightened order of Barbarians became the fathers and mothers of the **Human** race. Their Combine Empire spread throughout the known world, but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown. While they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath, and their relics and ruins still litter lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of their great empire remains.

#### Early Human Settlements - The Age of Enlightenment

To the west, a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, founded **Qeynos** under the lofty principles of law. To the east, **Freeport** grew into an active and dangerous port of call for all who dared venture into the Ocean of Tears. The great continent of Tunaria became known as **Antonica**.

Meanwhile, Human explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of Elves, Dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient, abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. When a discontented minority of leaders heard these tales, they became both jealous of the arts and races described therein and determined to see these lands for themselves.

#### Magic

Leaving a small network of spies behind them, Erud and the above mentioned discontents sailed west and landed upon the barren coast of Odus Island. They soon established **Erudin**, a city almost entirely within a towering castle inhabited by scribes and scholars called High Men. Within the castle walls they gathered and analyzed reports, captured books or scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. Soon many "Erudites" - wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters - occupied the great halls of Erudin, growing immensely in both power and knowledge.

#### Magic in War - The Age of Turmoil

Some years later, a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of necromancy and were branded heretics. For the first time in hundreds of years, the Erudites knew and engaged in civil war.

But war among the Erudites held one significant difference. In place of swords and bows, they used magic. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. The great arcane energies released in the final battle of the war opened an immense hole in the earth, leading to depths unknown. Along the sides of this chasm, the heretics built **Paineel**, their city of refuge.

#### And, in Kunark

*Tonight, Vanusk sat in silence until I asked him to continue. He wanted to know what we had learned. When we started to recite the tales back to him, he silenced us and asked again what we had learned. The Bane's leader ventured a guess and told him that the only constants seem to be struggle, death, war and deceit. He pulled back the edges of his mouth in what must have been an Iksar smile and said, "As goes Norrath, so goes Kunark. Now, you are ready to learn of my land."*

*He sat back, leaning his strong tail against the railing of our ship and looked south. "Since the beginning," he said, "Kunark has suffered under the shadow of the wurm." His fantastic tale continued over the last days of our sea journey.*

#### Shissir Kingdom

While the dragons took centuries to grow and organize, a race of intelligent snake men - the **Shissir** - assumed the forefront. The Shissir were a brutal race who enslaved the Iksar, using Vanusk's ancestors for workers and food. From their capital of Chelsith in what is now The Overthere, they explored dark rites and forgotten evils which would lay the foundation for much of Iksar knowledge and philosophy.

As learned from the rest of Norrath, nothing is permanent. Eventually, the Shissir angered even their own gods. A horrible plague destroyed every Shissir; however, the Iksar survived unscathed.

#### Iksar Nation

Over the next several centuries, the Iksar grew to greatness on the buried ashes of their former masters. They migrated outward across the continent of Kunark and formed five principal tribe-states: **Kylong**, **Nathsar**, **Obulus**, **Jarsath** and **Kunzar**. This last tribe-state was led by Venril Sathir, a young and powerful warrior-mage, who raised an unyielding army of undead with the assistance of dark magic.

Sathir and his Kunzar armies conquered and annexed the remaining tribe-states under his rule as the first King of Sebilis, the renamed Iksar nation. In order to build his Sebilisan Empire, Sathir brutally captured and enslaved the Hill Giants, Forest Giants and Froglok of Kunark. Throughout Sathir's life, the Sebilisan Empire quickly grew in might, power and grandeur.

#### The Rule of Rile

King Sathir aged, but, of course, he did not want to die. To cheat death, he made an unholy pact with Innoruuk to rise, undead and immortal. Rile, Sathir's heir, had other plans and thwarted the ritual. Sathir's soul was trapped inside an amulet that was hidden away as Rile cremated his father's body.

Rile assumed the throne; however, little changed in the kingdom. The son of Sathir seized more valuable land and his ruthless reputation increased under the terrors of his warlords: Kurn Machta, Karatukus, and the vampire Chosooth. By the time these warlords finished, most of the continent definitely belonged to Sebilis... all but a few pockets of Giants and Dragons.

#### The Ring of Scale

The Iksar had left the Dragon lands alone, but their threat was easy to see. The Dragon lords convened the Ring of Scale and argued about how to proceed. **Trakanon**, the large blue, advocated swift intervention on behalf of all races against the Iksar. However, Trakanon was voted down and the Ring of Scale decided to intervene only indirectly.

Trakanon and a number of the younger dragons decided more direct action was required. They conjured a squall at sea that destroyed Rile's warship while the King was on board. This action triggered a spectacular war among the Dragons that lasted for almost a half century. Since this Ring of Scale was, in all likelihood, responsible for the capture of our companion, we were understandably curious to learn as much as we could. Vanusk answered only one question with, "There are lesser dragons that fly across Norrath and pluck candidates for slavery to the Ring of Scale."

#### Atrebe's Iksar Empire

Atrebe, Rile's first-hatched son, then became King. This young Iksar was different from his father. He was reclusive and enamored of the dark arts. All feared his use of the evil magic of the Shissir and his grandfather, Sathir. His foul experiments joined a dragon with an Iksar, creating the **Sarnak**, a race of intelligent Dragon-men. He also joined a Dragon with a Froglok, creating flying mounts for his armies, the **Sokokar**. On these flying beasts, the Iksar were deadly. Soon, only the hardiest Dragonkind stood unconquered by the Sebilisan Empire.

#### Iksar vs. the Ring of Scale

Over the next half century, Dragonkind struggled against the Iksar's airborne army. Atrebe was succeeded by his son, Ganak, a most capable warrior. The war ended inconclusively over the Field of Bone with an aerial duel between Ganak on his Sokokar mount and Jaled-Dar, then leader of the Ring of Scale. Both were incinerated by magic and fire.

The Dragons retreated, but not before destroying the imperial palace and all Ganak's hatchlings in a daring final blaze of revenge.

#### The Emerald Circle

Instead of a new king, the Iksar nobles created the Emerald Circle, a body of five nobles who wisely worked to enhance the Iksar cities and trade, rebuild the navy, and return prosperity to the empire. Unfortunately, whenever the ambitions of rulers are involved, strife soon follows and the empire was ultimately divided into the original five tribal-states. Even that treaty was soon forgotten, as the tribes began to wrestle for supremacy over each other. Unbeknownst to the Iksar, the Ring of Scale had also rebuilt and was meddling in every alliance and affair, pitting the tribal-states one against another.

#### The End of the Sebilisan Empire

The slaves revolted in Sebilis. Goblin lords from Faydwer invaded Kunark. The Giants mustered an army and destroyed the warlord outposts before they attacked the cities. The final destructive attack on the Iksar came when Trakanon and his Dragon allies descended on what was left of the Iksar cities and reduced them to ashes and ruins. The grand Sebilisan Empire was no more. Free from Iksar restraints and rule, all the other races established themselves and began warring amongst themselves in their lust for domination.

*Two last warnings came from Vanusk as we bedded down for the evening. Our new friend told us that the undead King Venril Sathir had indeed been brought back into existence and ruled in Karnor, in The Dreadlands, a place he recommended we avoid. The second warning was to avoid the Frontier Mountains. That foul bastard race, the Sarnak, had set up outposts there to breed Goblin and Froglok slaves.*

*And now, the hour grows late. My notes are complete and I have prepared a new parchment to record upcoming events in our journey. I pray that Rallos Zek guide our will and that Vanusk will agree to guide our way to these mountains of Veeshan's children.*

---

### Letters and Transcripts

*The following letters and transcripts were recovered from various locations across Norrath, providing first-hand accounts of the frozen continent of Velious.*

#### Letter Transcript Recovered from Freeport

*Mentor,*

*I hope this reaches you before too much time has passed. In my last letter, I told you about securing passage on the gnomish vessel IceBreaker, which had recently begun making voyages from the Northern Desert of Ro to the frozen continent of Velious. Little did I know what was in store for me.*

*The IceBreaker is not your typical vessel. Built like all things gnomish, it is more about function than form or comfort. I will not bore you with the details of my wretched journey across the Iceclad Ocean. I will also refrain from commenting on the nature of the gnomes who crewed the vessel. Gnomish pirates, indeed!*

*Having already made several voyages from Antonica, the gnomes established a beach camp and constructed a rudimentary dock. Beyond that, they lacked for almost any real creature comfort. They made a few short forays inland, but mostly, they stuck close to the landing area, trading with a relatively peaceful tribe of gnolls that inhabited the area.*

*Since my companions and I embarked on this journey for the sake of discovery and adventure, we immediately set forth to explore this frozen land. Venturing west from the landing, we came across a tremendous bridge spanning a huge chasm in the ice. Nothing built by the fabled Combine Empire can compare to this massive construction, seemingly fashioned from the bones of a great dragon!*

*Across this bridge, and away from the ocean proper, we ran into our first trouble. Giants! And not the giants you may be familiar with. These giants were different. We all know the story about how the giants and other creations of Rallos Zek were cursed by The Rathe for making war upon the gods themselves. That curse does not seem to apply to these creatures, though how they managed to escape divine wrath is still a mystery to me. In any event, they are much more intelligent and organized than their lesser brethren, while every bit as fierce.*

*We lost two of our party to a small band of these creatures when first we set foot upon the eastern wastes of Velious, and those of us who survived were scattered. Finding myself alone, I was determined to continue my journey westward. Moving most carefully, and using all that I learned in my many years of adventuring, I managed to avoid several more bands of giants as well as war bands of orcs. Eventually, I came in sight of a large keep, obviously built for giants. Not wanting to venture into what I felt would be a very dangerous place; I struck off in the opposite direction.*

*After several days of travel, I left the realm of the giants and orcs. Though, to my puzzlement, there seemed to be signs of some other inhabitants. Old campfires at first, then cleverly disguised structures built into hillsides, showing signs of recent habitation. Imagine my surprise when while investigating one of these structures, I was confronted by a group of odd pale dwarves! While wary around me, they were not hostile, and were able to converse with me in a colorful dialect of Common. They called themselves the Coldain and agreed to take me to their fortress city of Thurgadin.*

*Words can not describe this city built under an icy mountain, so I shall not attempt it. Suffice to say that these dwarves are every bit as industrious and hardy as their cousins in Kaladim. I was brought before their king, Dain Frostreaver IV. This mighty warrior welcomed me to his realm, and proceeded to query me for information about the world beyond Velious. In the process, I learned much about Velious itself. The Coldain take a very serious view of their heritage and from very early childhood learn a great deal about their history. It is their firm belief that they were chosen by Brell to inhabit Velious.*

*During the ancient days when the first city of the dwarves was under construction, dwarves were sent across the lands and sea to find precious reserves of stone, crystal, and ore for the project. Ships sailed in and out by the dozens bringing supplies for the great city. One fleet of such ships sailed across the South of Antonica to reach the island we know as Odus, where a quartz mine was to be set up in the name of the dwarves.*

*Led by the miner and explorer Colin Dain, the fleet carrying several hundred dwarves ran into one of the worst storms Prexus had ever unleashed. The storm raged on for days as most of the dwarves huddled together in the ships' holds waiting for the seas to calm. When at last the storm passed, they found themselves utterly lost. Even the best of the captains and navigators had no clue as to where they were. The stars in the sky could not be relied upon for navigation, as none of them were recognizable to the dwarves.*

*Using typical dwarven logic, Colin Dain picked a direction to sail and decided that their only hope was to keep sailing in that direction until they spotted land. As the days and then weeks went by the only noticeable change was that the weather began to get cold. Some nights were so cold that dwarves froze to death on the deck, turned into a statue of ice by the cruel weather.*

*Only the determination of Colin Dain kept the dwarves' hopes alive as he moved from ship to ship, assuring the dwarves that they would, "Hit land soon, if not tomorrow then the day after." Eventually Colin's words rang true as the dwarves did indeed spot a gigantic white landmass in the distance.*

*The landing proved to be as deadly as the voyage when icebergs both small and large tore the small fleet apart. Not a single ship made it to shore. Most were torn apart far from the land, and many dwarves met Death at the hands of the ocean. Less than a hundred made it onto an icy beach.*

*With no serviceable ships, Colin Dain wasted little time leading his people from the shoreline. He knew they would have to find shelter to keep from dying in the cold. He also knew they would need to find wood and other supplies so they could repair their ships and set off for fairer lands. So the quartz miners from the north settled in caves a few miles inland from where they landed. These caves were set into a giant mountain of ice and snow in the northern section of the Eastern Wastes.*

*There is an old saying that goes, "Dwarves are like time itself, neither can remain idle." This certainly proved true for the new settlement. The miners quickly discovered that the hard packed ice lying beneath the snow of Velious was as durable and malleable as stone, and ideally suited for construction in this frozen land. They would later discover that the ice, known as Velium, had magical properties as well.*

*Through time the cave settlement became a town, and then a strong dwarven keep began to take shape within the mountain. Named Froststone for the ice out of which it was built, the dwarves knew that with the completion of this keep their stay on this strange new land was permanent. Unfortunately the peace of the dwarves was shattered when they encountered another race upon Velious, the frost giants.*

*It was with great surprise that the dwarves woke up one day to find their home under siege by an army of giants. The frost giants inhabited the Eastern Wastes and considered those lands their home. They did not take kindly to the puny children of Brell building a fortress along their border. After much battle, the dwarves realized they could not possibly hold out against their large foes.*

*In desperation, Colin Dain led them from their new home in the Great Divide to the only place they could go - deeper into the mountains. The frost giants pursued, so a small group of dwarves volunteered to stay behind to allow the others to escape. Colin Dain himself led the suicide ambush, buying his people enough time to escape the giants. From this time onward the dwarves would refer to themselves as the Coldain in honor of their beloved leader. Furthermore, the leader of their people would carry the title "Dain."*

*While hiding out in the frigid caverns a Coldain miner by the name of Glight Snowchipper received a vision from Brell. The vision was of a labyrinth of ice where the dwarves could hide from the frost giants. In the narrow passageways, it was hoped that the giants would become lost and fall into the many traps the dwarves would construct. Glight presented his idea to Dain Frostreaver, the son of Colin Dain, who began construction of the labyrinth. The Crystal Caverns were completed in a little under half a century. The speed of the project alone was proof to the Coldain that Glight had indeed been inspired by Brell. These caverns of Crystal would be the salvation of the Coldain race.*

*The true test of the caverns worth came nearly thirty years later, when by following a party of Coldain, the frost giants discovered the location of the Crystal Caverns. Slagd Frozentoe of the frost giants led the invasion force of warriors to the cavern, hoping to wipe the hated Coldain from Velious once and for all. Glight Snowchipper, in the fashion of Colin Dain, led the defense, drawing the frost giants deep into the confusing caverns. His magical pickaxe, aptly named Snowchipper, felled many a giant's as the dwarves struck repeatedly from hidden passages and around shadowy corridors.*

*Despite losing most of his force, Slagd and the remaining giants almost made it to the Coldain city in the center of the caverns when Glight pulled off his greatest and final trick. Thousands of tons of ice and stone crashed into Slagd and his remaining giants after Glight and a few of his brave miners led them down a false passage. Unfortunately it was an act of self-sacrifice as Glight and his fellows were also buried in the avalanche. The miners of Thurgadin still call themselves Snowchippers, in honor of Glight.*

*Over the next few centuries strange creatures began migrating into the Crystal Caverns. It was these foes and more which eventually caused the dwarves to abandon the caverns and set out to build a new fortress more akin to Frostkeep. I was cautioned to avoid the old caverns, as they still hold many dangers.*

*The Coldain retreated even deeper into the Great Divide. Led by Dain Frostreaver II, they founded the city of Thurgadin, or New Froststone.*

*Constructed on the northern edge of the Great Divide, Thurgadin lies within a glacial mountain rich with untouched supplies of velium and other ores. The outer region of the city is carved into the ancient glacial ice, while the inner region pierces the mountain rock where the precious ores are mined.*

*The Coldain are determined not to lose this home. Thurgadin is built in a very defensive manner, with passage through long tunnels lined with murder holes being necessary to get to the inner city. At the heart of the city lies Icewell Keep, where the Dain and his council of advisors reside and where he granted audience to me.*

*Surrounding the castle are the forges and shops that make up the mainstay of Coldain commerce. Mines burrow deeper into the mountains, some ending in cleverly hidden and easily collapsible escape hatches for easy access into the Great Divide. I have used my meager cartography skills to fashion a map of Thurgadin, which I am sending you with this letter.*

*I have decided to reside in Thurgadin for a time, to better get to know my hosts, and to assist them in rejoining the community of beings of Antonica and Faydwer. I feel very secure here in this mountain stronghold, and I think there is much to accomplish.*

*As always,*
*Solist Kinslan*

#### Letter Transcript Recovered from Halas

*McTarnigal,*

*Took the gnome ship, the trip was bad. Ship was too cramped, not built for a Halasman. What is, outside of Halas? Made it to Velious with a strong group of Southrons. Weather was fine, looks like a nice place, plenty to eat, and plenty to fight. Not enough to drink, stupid gnomes lost all the rum.*

*Went inland, saw a strange tower, steered clear of it, it reeked of sick magic. Found a large bridge. Would not want to defend it, too big. Crossed the bridge, good country there. Looks like an excellent place to live. Found Kromrif here too. Thought frost giants were all dead. They are not.*

*Party was ambushed by Kromrif war band, some died, and others ran. I fought. Clubbed till I went black. Woke up being carried into giant fortress. Saw banners of Lord Rallos, gave homage. Kromrif saw this, nodded.*

*Taken to true leaders of city. Kromzek. Storm giants are still alive, and still strong. Someone should hit Margyn McCann over the head, her lore is wrong.*

*The King of Kromzek, Tormax, asked me many questions. Found out Kromzek and Kromrif escaped the curse. Kromrif are warring with ice dwarves to the north. Kromzek are trying to expand west, fighting a savage forest claimed by Tunare.*

*They also fight Dragons. Very bad blood between the Velious dragons and Kromzek. Tormax sits on the bones of a dragon queen his sire killed.*

*Tomorrow I go out with a war band of Kromzek and Kromrif, heading west through forest to a dragon shrine, to do battle there. May Zek give me strength.*

*I am giving this letter to a Kromrif who is going east, to hand to the gnomes. Tell the warriors of Halas that Rallos Zek is strong here. Many chances for battle and conquest. Bring your own beer.*

*Breen Everblood.*

#### Letter Transcript Recovered from Qeynos

*Hanns,*

*When I get back to Qeynos, I'm going to knock a few of your teeth out. I'm still not sure how you convinced me to make this trip, though I'm thinking Crow's Special Brew had something to do with it.*

*Leaving the new dock in North Ro, I took a launch that carried me out to the Iceclad Ocean. There I boarded IceBreaker, a so-called ship constructed by the gnomes. Several other people had booked passage for this voyage and were awaiting my arrival, including my comrades Tolan, Breen, and Solist.*

*It wasn't a fun trip. The ship's hammers were constantly clanking and banging, those blasted gnomes were making silly pirate noises, and it was cold. It nearly drove me crazy.*

*We finally made landing at a beachhead the gnomes constructed, but found little in the way of luxuries. The gnomes even managed to misplace the horrible rum that kept us warm during the voyage. And before you ask, I had nothing to do with that misplacement.*

*After looking around the landing, the group of us decided to head west, beyond the area the gnomes had explored. We passed quite a few interesting sights, and a tower I really wanted to inspect, but Solist and Breen both said to avoid it, so we continued on. After crossing a bridge that was so high it made even me dizzy, our luck ran out.*

*A group of well-organized giants took us by surprise. Deciding discretion was called for, I managed to duck out of the battle when it was obvious we were losing. Several people, including Solist, managed to escape, while Breen went down fighting, buried under a pile of giants. After the dust settled, I saw the giants carrying Breen off to the southwest and decided to follow them.*

*After a few hours of sneaking along, I was startled by a voice behind me. Tolan! The clever ranger had escaped the giant ambush the same way I had, and was tracking the giants and me across the wastes. We continued to follow the giants, and eventually came to a great fortress city.*

*With luck and skill, the two of us managed to sneak inside the city. We tried to find Breen, but there was no way to know for sure where he had been taken. The chance of getting caught was high, since the place was crawling with giants. We eventually passed through the city itself, and found ourselves on the edge of a huge forest.*

*The giants were working hard to push the forest back, but according to Tolan, they weren't doing well. He said he felt great power in the woods, stronger even than the heart of Faydark. I didn't question his statement; I could feel the life here myself.*

*At Tolan's urging we left the giant city behind and traveled on through the forest. Tolan grew more and more excited, saying he felt we were nearing something amazing.*

*Tolan's woods lore gave us no warning when a group of strange flying creatures suddenly appeared. Finding ourselves quickly captured, we were trussed, blindfolded, and gagged. We were carried to the heart of the forest where a gathering of beings awaited us. They would not speak to me. But they jabbered with Tolan for a long while in a strange language.*

*Again I was blindfolded and carried through the forest. After some time I was put down and my bonds cut. I was at the edge of a clearing, facing the giant city. Tolan was there, unbound and smiling. He told me I should make my way back to the Iceclad Ocean. I wasn't welcome in this land, and to go any further west would be a bad idea. Dragons would kill me if I entered the shrine they had built on the other side of the forest. That is if I made it that far, since there was always the chance that the forest creatures would decide to have me for lunch.*

*When I asked Tolan what he was going to do, he said he would be staying there for a time as a guest. He was a grown man; I assume he knew his own business. Not wanting to overstay my welcome, I took Tolan's advice and said goodbye. I went back through the giant city (still no sign of Breen), across the wastes, and eventually, back to the shores of the Iceclad Ocean, where I sit now.*

*I'm going to head back out again soon to look for Breen, Solist, and the others. I wouldn't feel right abandoning them at this point, and besides, it could turn out to be profitable.*

*Regards,*
*Mrylokar*

Once your subscription is set up, you simply need to connect to a game server:

1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on the desktop.
2. Type in your Sony Station password and then click **Connect**. The screen that displays lists all of the available game servers. The number to the right of each server name shows how many players are currently connected.
3. Click on a server name, then click the large **Play EverQuest** button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.

> **IMPORTANT!** Your character only exists on the server on which it's created. In other words, if you create "Gazimbu" on one server, you can't connect to another server and use that character. Make sure you record the server name for each of your characters.

Your next step is to create a character. You can store up to eight characters on each game server.

#### Using the Tutorial

EverQuest includes a tutorial you can play without being connected to the Internet. To access the tutorial, double-click the EverQuest tutorial icon on the desktop.

The tutorial familiarizes you with some basics of the game - moving around, talking to people, using your inventory and fighting. Read the stone marker in front of you, then approach Prumpy Irontoe on the bridge. Press `Esc` to exit the tutorial at any time.

#### Exiting the Game

Before you can exit EverQuest, you must set up camp using the Macro buttons. This process takes a few moments, so make sure you're in a relatively safe place first.

Your character does not require food, drink or rest whenever you're not playing. The next time you start the game, your character's previous condition is restored. (For example, if you were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when you resume playing.)

**To camp and exit:**
1. Display the Main Macro buttons by clicking **Main**.
2. Click **Sit**. Then, click **Camp** and wait about 30 seconds.
3. When the Login screen displays, click **Exit**.

> **IMPORTANT!** If your character dies with valuable items in inventory, don't exit the game until you've recovered everything from your corpse. Your body only survives for so long, so if you wait, the body may disappear before you find it. The time varies, depending on your character's level and whether you're logged into the game or not.

**Corpse Decay Times:**

*If your account is still logged on:*
- Level 1-5: 30 minutes
- Level 6+: 24 hours

*If you're not logged into the game:*
- Level 1-5: 30 minutes
- Level 6+: 7 days

*If you don't have any items (regardless of whether you're in the game or not):*
- Level 1-29: 3 minutes
- Level 30+: 3 hours

*(Please note that time offline and time online does compound. Ex: 12 hours online means you have 3.5 days of time left)*

---

### Creating a Character

Once you log in and select a game server, the Character Select screen appears. It lets you create, manage and delete characters. Each of the eight Create New Character slots can store a single character that you create. This section shows you how to create a character, step-by-step.

#### Character Creation Screen

This screen lets you build your character through a series of steps:

1. Pick a race
2. Pick an occupation (class)
3. Allocate ability points
4. Pick a facial appearance
5. Pick a name
6. Choose a deity (religion)
7. Pick a starting city

#### Step 1 - Pick a Race

Norrath has 13 known races, each of which was established in a specific region of Norrath. All have unique talents and professions, some more than others - for example, Humans are relatively smart and can pursue nearly all professions, while Ogres have fewer options, but excel in physical strength.

Click a race to select it. (Notice that the starting statistics and the list of available occupations change for each race.)

**Barbarian.** Warriors at heart, most of the Barbarians' history revolves around one war or another.
- Starting city: Halas
- Occupations: Rogue, Shaman, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls

**Dark Elf.** Dark Elves share the heritage and features of other elves in Norrath, but they are more evilly aligned. Home is almost always underground; darkness poses no obstacle for Dark Elves.
- Starting city: Neriak
- Occupations: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard
- Racial tensions: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans, Iksar, Wood Elves

**Dwarf.** Short but strong, Dwarves outperform Humans in nearly all physical tasks. Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded by their dexterity.
- Starting city: Kaladim
- Occupations: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Iksar

**Erudite.** Self-pride and intellect persuade most Erudites to forego physical activity in favor of mental challenges. Social grace is their forte, and they believe themselves to be the pinnacle of evolution.
- Starting city: Erudin
- Occupations: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard, Shadow Knight
- Racial tensions: Dark Elves, Iksar

**Gnome.** Distant cousins to Dwarves, Gnomes tend to burrow in the hillsides in underground communities. A lack of surface light lends a tan hue to their skin tone, and they rarely emerge to mingle with other races.
- Starting city: Ak'anon
- Occupations: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard
- Racial tensions: Iksar

**Half Elf.** As Human-Elf hybrids, Half Elves share the prominent physical features of both races. Their intellect is a notch above most other races, though they suffer a lack of strength as compared to the other Norrathian races.
- Starting city: Qeynos, Freeport, Kelethin
- Occupations: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls

**Halfling.** Short and Human-like, Halflings are by far the most nimble and mobile race in the world. Outstanding dexterity and agility come naturally, and they're natural travelers. Because of this, Halflings have developed peaceful relations with all other races.
- Starting city: Rivervale
- Occupations: Cleric, Druid, Rogue, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Iksar

**High Elf.** Though they have physical traits in common with Woodland Elves, High Elves are far more developed in the ways of the mind. Pale and thin, they prefer to bide their time exercising the confines of the mind, and not the body.
- Starting city: Felwithe
- Occupations: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard
- Racial tensions: Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves

**Human.** Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath.
- Starting city: Qeynos, Freeport
- Occupations: All but Shaman
- Racial tensions: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls

**Iksar.** A tribal race, these lizard-like warriors carry on a rich heritage of conquest, enslavement and destruction. Iksar are quite intelligent (despite their gargantuan size and warrior-like ways) and prefer to socialize within their own circles.
- Starting city: New Sebilis (also known as Cabilis)
- Occupations: Shaman, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, Monk, Warrior
- Racial Tensions: All other races

**Ogre.** Ogres spend as much time on the battlefield as Erudites and High Elves do exploring their intellect. With their gargantuan size and strength, they pass most of their days munching on available game and rarely give any thought to pursuing other interests.
- Starting city: Oggok
- Occupations: Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans, Iksar, Wood Elves

**Troll.** Despite a two-foot height difference, Trolls get along famously with Ogres, sharing similar likes, dislikes and pastimes. Outdoorsy and not quite bright, they're easily recognizable due to their skin's natural green tinge.
- Starting city: Grobb
- Occupations: Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans, Iksar, Wood Elves

**Wood Elf.** Yet another variation on the Elven-Human theme, Wood Elves are slightly weaker than Humans, but highly dextrous and agile. Their innate ability to act in the interest of fairness and justice often leads them to dedicate their lives to the good of society.
- Starting city: Kelethin
- Occupations: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior
- Racial tensions: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls

#### Step 2 - Pick an Occupation (Class)

Your occupation (or class) describes your career goal in the game. You can pursue any life you choose in EverQuest, so long as your race permits it.

Click an occupation to select it. (Note that each occupation gives you specific attributes that are marked with green numbers. When allocating ability points, concentrate on these characteristics.)

**Bard.** The Bard has the unusual ability to play magical songs, whose supernatural effects last as long as the Bard continues to sing. He has some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (self-defense), but his main focus is always his art.
- Modifiers: +5 Strength, +10 Dexterity, +10 Charisma

**Cleric.** A Cleric is a holy woman born with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of her deity to smite her foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains her ability.
- Modifiers: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom

**Druid.** A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to call upon Nature for aid and defense.
- Modifiers: +10 Stamina, +10 Wisdom

**Enchanter.** The primary focus of this art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which it belongs - enchantment. Spells are crafted to enchant people, places and things. An Enchanter can charm beings and make them fight for a new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword-wielding warrior. She even has some proficiency in offensive spells.
- Modifiers: +10 Intelligence, +10 Charisma

**Magician.** The Magician is the summoner of the arcane arts, and can conjure up everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight on his behalf. While not as offensively adept as a Wizard, a Magician still possesses considerable spell power.
- Modifiers: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence

**Monk.** The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor. She's very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless Monks by magically enhancing their attacks.
- Modifiers: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity

**Necromancer.** The Necromancer belongs to the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spells, he can animate dead bodies and skeletons to do his bidding, as well as cast spells to leach life from his victims.
- Modifiers: +10 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence

**Paladin.** A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to Lay Hands.
- Modifiers: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +5 Wisdom, +10 Charisma

**Ranger.** The Ranger is a hybrid mix between a Warrior and a Druid, sharing the skills of both. He's most at home in the great outdoors.
- Modifiers: +5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom

**Rogue.** Falling somewhere between an assassin and a thief, the Rogue belongs to the secretive class of Norrath. She's quite skilled in weaponry, but prefers to make sudden attacks from behind. Shadier skills include Pick Lock and Pick Pockets.
- Modifiers: +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity

**Shadow Knight.** The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight derives power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part Necromancer and has the innate ability to Harm Touch.
- Modifiers: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Intelligence, +5 Charisma

**Shaman.** Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.
- Modifiers: +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma

**Warrior.** A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much punishment as he doles out. By nature, Warriors have more health points than any other class.
- Modifiers: +10 Strength, +10 Stamina, +5 Agility

**Wizard.** The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of destruction.
- Modifiers: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence

#### Step 3 - Allocate Ability Points

Your character has primary and secondary statistics. Primary ones are bright green, and represent abilities most beneficial to your chosen occupation. The others are secondary, which means they still affect you, but aren't quite as important.

The box in the top right corner of the screen shows your bonus ability points. The amount differs by race and/or occupation. You can add these points to any ability - but you should probably add most of them to your green "primary" abilities.

- Click "+" to add a bonus point to an ability.
- Click "-" to remove a bonus point from an ability. (You can't decrease any ability below its starting value, however.)

**Agility.** Physical ability; affects your probability of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some skills.

**Charisma.** How various factions react to you; affects prices for some merchants. Also affects spell effects for Enchanters and Bards, and helps Bards successfully play more notes.

**Dexterity.** Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects some skills and Bard songs.

**Intelligence.** Affects how fast you learn many skills. For a Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard, it also affects maximum mana at each level.

**Stamina.** Health and constitution; affects your maximum number of hit points at each level.

**Strength.** Physical strength; affects how much you can carry, how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some skills.

**Wisdom.** Affects how fast you learn specific skills. For a Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at each level.

#### Step 4 - Pick a Facial Appearance

To change your character's face, click **Face** just above the picture of your character. Click the arrows to cycle through different facial appearances. To return to the full view of your character, click **Body**.

#### Step 5 - Pick a Name

Either type in a name, or click **Get Name** to let the computer pick a name for you. You can't use spaces, dashes or special characters (#, ?, etc.).

- Click in the name field and type. Use `Backspace` to erase characters.
- Click **Next** to proceed.

#### Step 6 - Pick a Deity

The Deity Selection screen displays once you click Next from the Character Creation screen. Depending on your occupation and race, you can either choose from several of 18 specific deities, or remain agnostic (not a believer in either the existence or non-existence of deities).

Click a deity to select it. The name of the god appears in the text to the right.

**Bertoxxulous.** Lovers of death and disease; dedicated to spreading both.

**Brell Serilis.** Chosen inhabitants of the underground; slightly antagonistic.

**Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe.** True believers of fun and mischief; doctrine disregards trust and honesty.

**Cazic-Thule.** Followers are ruled by fear; hate, cruelty and torture abound.

**Erollisi Marr.** Defend justice and love.

**Innoruuk.** The Prince of Hate; believers are full of spite and evil.

**Karana.** God of storms and rain; followers are protectors of nature.

**Mithaniel Marr.** The Truthbringer; followers value honor and valor.

**Prexus.** The Ocean Lord; sailors and fishermen worship him.

**Quellious.** Masters of inner peace and enlightenment; knowing one's true self will help bring peace to Norrath.

**Rallos Zek.** Warriors to the end; emphasizes survival of the strong and the true value of conflict.

**Rodcet Nife.** Selfless servants to the weak and diseased; preaches healing and cleansing as one's life work.

**Solusek Ro.** The Burning Prince; followers worship fire and the sun.

**The Tribunal.** The judges of Norrath; believers value justice above all.

**Tunare.** The Mother of All; nature worshippers follow her.

**Veeshan.** The Wurmqueen; dragon worshippers.

> **Factions:** Consider your deity choice carefully - you can't change it later, and it affects your faction standing with other groups. Your standing is simply how you're perceived by other groups, or factions. (Innoruuk believers of hate aren't welcome at the Paladin's temple in Qeynos, for example.)
>
> Certain actions you perform in the game can improve or harm your standing with a particular group. Any time this happens, you are given a message on your text display. You'll probably want to pay close attention to any faction messages you receive - the more advanced your character, the more important your faction rating becomes.

#### Step 7 - Pick a Starting City

The world of Norrath is populated with many cities, but not all are friendly to all races, occupations and beliefs. Race is the primary factor that determines your starting city - you'll always be able to start in at least one of the cities listed in Race. However, choosing a certain deity or occupation may affect your starting city.

You can start from any city with a light blue or yellow name. (You may be able to choose between two or more cities, or you might only have a single option.) The currently selected city's name is yellow; cities you cannot start from are red.

- Click a city to select it. (You may or may not have more than one choice.)
- Click **Next** twice to return to the Character Selection screen.

> **Tip:** If you're planning on playing with your friends in a new city, make sure everyone has a compatible race, occupation and deity.

### Quick Interface Overview

The EverQuest interface consists of a single screen that shows information, as well as buttons that let you access many different functions. This section introduces you to the interface and tells you where to find more specific information related to each part of the interface.

#### Text Interface

The text display is your communication window to Norrath - through it, you can listen to conversations and talk to other characters in the game. By using special commands, you can speak privately with a single person or group, show your emotions or ask for help from an EverQuest Game Master.

**To talk to someone:**
1. Target someone (click on a character).
2. Press `H` to hail the character.
3. Press `Enter` to display the chat bar.
4. Type in your message, then press `Enter` to send your message.

For more details on communicating, see Communicating, and Advanced Chat Commands.

#### Interface Functions

EverQuest has one General screen that lets you access all of the interface functions. Because functions are tied to a particular task, information on using each function is covered under the appropriate section. For example, the Inventory screen is covered under Manipulating Items, because you use the Inventory page to manage your possessions.

Here are the elements of the interface:

- **A. Vital Statistics.** Monitor health (red), mana (blue) and fatigue level (yellow).
- **B. Text Display.** Send and receive messages. Right-click to view chat options.
- **C. Persona.** Click to access your Inventory, character photo, skill rankings and statistics.
- **D. Spells.** Access your spellbook (also opens your Inventory page).
- **E. Macro Buttons.** Select/define/use buttons in different categories.
- **F. Hot Buttons.** Store Macro buttons (6 sets of 10).
- **G. View.** Cycle through views of your character.
- **H. Viewing Area.** See the world around you.
- **I. Effects.** See results of spells and other special effects on your character (toggle).
- **J. Party.** View names/health bars for players who have joined your party.
- **K. Help/Game Options.** View abbreviated, online manual and access Game Options.

#### Macro Buttons

The Ability, Skill and Social buttons on the right side of the screen display Macro buttons. You can program them with certain skills or actions. (The Social buttons already have functionality, but you can change them.) Then, you can simply click a button to use that skill or social action.

**To program an Ability or Combat button:**
1. Click **Ability** or **Combat**, then right-click on any Macro button.
2. For Abilities and Combat, a list of skills appears. Click on a skill to assign it to the selected slot. You can overwrite a slot that's already filled.

**To program a Social button:**
1. Click **Social**, then right-click on any Macro button.
2. A screen appears that lists five rows. The top row contains the current "/" command, while the other rows are empty. You can put a different text command in each row, but only one can be active at a time.
3. Click in a slot and type in a new command (like "/shout"). You can use any slash command.
4. If you desire, change the name that appears on the Macro button.
5. If you've programmed multiple slots, click on the slot you want to activate. (The button name does not change, however.)

> **Note:** You may have noticed that the Ability Macro buttons only appear if you click Ability, the Combat ones only if you click Combat, and the Social buttons only if you click Social. Switching categories can get cumbersome after you've played for a while. You can create a copy of any interface button and add it to a Hot button on the left side of the interface. See Hot Buttons, for details.

---

### Moving Around

The keyboard is your main control for movement in EverQuest, while the mouse controls the cursor and your current point of view.

#### Running and Walking

To walk forward and backward, press the arrow keys on the keyboard or the Numpad keys. You can toggle running instead by clicking **Run** (Main Macro button screen).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`, `↓` or Numpad `8`, `2` | Walk forward/backward |
| `←`, `→` or Numpad `4`, `6` | Turn left/right |
| `Ctrl` + `←`, `→` | Step sideways |
| `=` | Toggle running (click Run button on interface) |
| `Num Lock` | Toggles AutoRun feature |

#### Jumping and Crouching

You may occasionally need to duck down or jump to evade obstacles:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Spacebar` | Jump (while running, walking or standing) |
| `C` | Crouch down |

#### Looking Around

To look around, right-click-and-hold while you move the mouse (make sure mouse panning is active). Alternatively, press the Numpad keys, or hold down `Alt` and press the arrow keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F12` | Toggle mouse panning on/off |
| Numpad `8` | Look up |
| Numpad `2` | Look down |
| Numpad `5` | Look straight ahead |
| Numpad `+` | Zoom view in |
| Numpad `-` | Zoom view out |

#### Sitting and Camping

The SIT and CAMP buttons are located in the Main set of Macro buttons.

Whenever you're resting, you should sit down. This consumes less energy than standing or walking.
- Click **SIT** button on interface (in Main buttons)

Camp when you're ready to exit the game. This process takes about 30 seconds.
- Click **CAMP** button on interface (in Main buttons)

> **Jargon Note:** If you hear other players talking about "camping", they may not be referring to the camp command - rather, they may mean they're "camping out" in a specific spot, perhaps waiting for a particular creature to spawn.

#### Safe vs. Dangerous Locations

As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and other players can't kill you. (On most servers you have to become a player-killer, or PK, to give other players permission to attack you. You do this by giving a Priest of Discord the Tome of Order and Discord in your inventory. The exceptions are the PvP servers.) If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous guards immediately come to the rescue, providing that they are fond of you. Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.

Once you venture into the wilderness, you're fair game for any non-player predators out there. Gnoll pups are notorious for ganging up on solo travelers, as are Kobolds.

#### Sense Heading Skill

It's easy to get lost in EverQuest. Luckily, all characters have a basic skill called Sense Heading that helps determine your current compass direction. The downside is that this takes a while to learn and perfect.

To use this skill, map the Sense Heading skill to a Macro button. Practice this skill as often as you can - it will help you improve. Whenever you successfully use this skill, a message appears in your text display - something like "You think you are heading South."

#### Maps

You'll find city maps that help you identify landmarks within each city. The game also contains a cloth map that shows the entire world. Part of EverQuest's appeal is to explore your way through all of Norrath's cities. So, while the maps don't show each and every building, they have enough information to send you on your way.

You can travel between cities by following the roads at the entrance point for each city, or traveling by boat. However, traveling alone isn't always safe - try associating with a party beforehand.

#### Swimming

Most cities in Norrath are conveniently located near ponds or large bodies of water, and some even have fountains and underwater aqueduct systems. You can swim in water for a short period of time. The better you are at swimming, the longer you can hold your breath.

**To swim:**
1. Walk into the water.
2. Pan your view down.
3. Watch your air gauge. When it gets low, emerge for air.
4. Pan your view up to take a breath.

> **Note:** You can swim with your head above water by panning the view up slightly.

#### Modes of Transportation

In EverQuest, you can travel via several methods. You've already learned how to walk, run and swim (short distances). From most cities, you can also take a boat or use teleport spells.

**To take a boat:**
1. Find a pier and stand or sit on the edge.
2. When a boat arrives, walk onto it.

To be teleported, you must either know a teleporting spell, or find a magical player to cast one on you. Some teleport spells affect only the user or target, while others can teleport entire groups of characters.

---

### Communicating

EverQuest provides an ongoing source of social interaction. You can chat with fellow players on chat boards, or talk to NPCs and other players within the game.

In general, whenever you send a message, all players in the immediate vicinity "hear" you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text portion of their screens (their Text Displays). However, you can also target certain players or groups to send private messages.

You send messages using the Chat Bar, and all communications from all characters show up as text in the Text Display.

**To send messages to characters in the game:**
1. Press `Enter` to display the Chat Bar.
2. Type your message.
3. Press `Enter` to send the message.

**To talk to a non-player character (such as a shopkeeper NPC), "hail" him or her:**
1. Click on the character, then press `H`.
2. They'll usually say something to you. Words in [brackets] indicate keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions. You may get some useful information, or even a quest.

> **IMPORTANT!** Make sure you press `Enter` firmly - otherwise, typing a message may actually trigger actions assigned to the keys you type. For example, typing `A` without first pressing `Enter` toggles Auto-Attack on, even if your only intention is to talk. We strongly suggest that you remap this key, just for this reason.

> **Note:** However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using inappropriate language. The job of the Game Masters is to maintain this fantasy world and ensure that everyone has a pleasurable playing experience.

#### Talking to Merchants

Merchants usually greet you when you first walk into their store or selling booth, but they don't often like to talk about anything outside of their immediate realm of existence. (In other words, don't ask a merchant for directions or favors....)

Before talking to a merchant, you must target him or her. To do so, move the cursor over the merchant and click. To speak to the merchant, press `H`. To see what the merchant has for sale, right-click on the merchant.

| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Target, then hail a merchant | `H` |
| View a merchant's goods | Right-click |

#### Talking to Players/Other NPCs

You can target and hail other NPCs and fellow players just as you do merchants. (You don't have to hail player characters, but it will alert them to the fact that you're trying to communicate.)

| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Hail a player or NPC | Click, then `H` |

To send messages to other players, press `Enter` to start a message. A small text window appears at the bottom of your screen. Type your message (up to 55 characters in length) and press `Enter` again to send it. (This is referred to as "chatting," but isn't the same as using chat boards.)

| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Toggle chat bar | `Enter` (press to start message; again to send) |

#### Editing/Viewing Chat Text

You can move the cursor or edit a line of text before sending a message:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift` + `Del` | Delete current chat line |
| `Backspace` | Replace current chat line |
| `Del`, `Backspace` | Delete character to right/left of cursor |
| `←`, `→` | Move cursor left/right |
| `Home` | Move cursor to start of chat line |
| `Shift` + `End` | Move cursor to end of chat line |

All messages you've received since you logged into the game are stored in the Text Display. Scroll through them by clicking the scroll arrows or by using keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Page Up`, `Page Down` | Scroll chat history up/down |

#### Sending Messages to Certain Targets

Normally, your messages appear in black text, and only players within earshot can view them. EverQuest has special chat modes that let you send messages to a specific target - for example, to a single player, all players in the city - or "out-of-character" messages.

To select a special chat mode, right-click inside the text window and highlight a mode.

If you select a mode checkbox from within the text window, that mode remains "sticky," or active until you change it. Remember to change the mode back to "say" when you're through, or you won't be able to communicate with all players.

#### Chat Modes

**Say.** (Default) Send all messages to all nearby characters.

**Shout.** Send all messages to all characters in your playing zone. All messages you type appear in bold, red text. Use this if you need to tell everyone trouble is coming, or need to locate your party quickly. Don't overuse shout, however - it can be annoying to other players.

**Tell.** Send all messages to a single player. No matter how far away you are, that character receives your messages.

**Group.** Send all messages to a single group of players. This helps keep your group organized and informed, and no one outside of your group receives your messages. All party members hear you, no matter where they are.

**Out of Character.** Speak out of the context of the game and your character. Use this if you're having a problem or have a question that doesn't pertain directly to the game. These messages display as bright green text to anyone within your playing zone. Again, don't overuse this.

**Auction.** Send a buy/sell message out to all players in the playing zone. Use this if you've just acquired an impressive item, especially if you're out in the wilderness and don't want to return to town. Remember that auction messages are used for selling goods and materials, not for chatting.

#### Changing Chat Modes on the Fly

You can also apply a chat mode to a single message without changing the mode that is selected in the Chat Box. Type `/` followed by the mode name, a space and then your message - for instance, "/shout Nixx Darkpaw is heading this way!" You must press `Enter` to send the message.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/` | Start a special chat message (type a chat mode, then your message, followed by `Enter`) |
| `/tell` | Speak to a specific player |
| `/shout` | Shout to all characters |
| `/yell` | Shout a plea for help to players within 30-foot radius |
| `/ooc` | Speak out of character |
| `/gsay`, `/g` | Speak only to your group |
| `/gu` | Guild chat |
| `/auction` | Shout a buy or sell message |

You can use `/` to send dozens of different special message types and to receive valuable pieces of information. See Advanced Chat Commands, for a list of advanced commands.

To make any chat command instantly accessible, program it onto a Social macro button.

#### Sending Action Messages (Emoticons)

You can appear to bow, be bored, point, or convey other visible gestures by using other special commands. EverQuest has a lengthy list of built-in emotes, and some even trigger animations.

If you don't want to use pre-defined "emoticons," you can type in virtually anything. (You won't really perform a visible action, but other players can see text that indicates your action.) Simply press `Enter`, then type `/` followed by the "action" you want to show other players. You can also type "/em" and a message.

#### Using Different Languages

All characters in the world communicate using a Common Tongue by default, no matter who or what they are. However, most races also possess the ability to speak in a native language.

**To switch languages:**
1. Right-click on the Text Display window.
2. Click on your current language to cycle through available tongues.

Once you switch languages, only characters that also speak that language will be able to understand what you say. To others, your words will appear as gibberish.

#### Communicating with Pets

In some occupations, you can use spells to tame or enchant creatures and claim them as pets. Pets protect you and can follow a number of commands that you type in. See Using Pets for details.

#### "Feeling Out" Strangers

All EverQuest inhabitants can detect hostility from a stranger. This ability, called consideration, lets you know (through a text message) how a targeted NPC/player/monster feels about you. In general, this helps you assess your target's perception of you. It also comes in handy when you're considering whether or not to attack a monster or other player.

You can Consider any NPC, player or monster in the game. When Considering merchants, however, you have to do so from a distance (or type the /consider command).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `C` or Right-click | Consider a player, NPC or creature |

#### Posting to Chat Boards

EverQuest's chat boards are not accessible from within the game. Instead, click Chat from the Login screen (which appears when you activate the EverQuest desktop icon). You can use chat boards to speak to other players about the game and ask questions. Other players are often a great source for answers.

---

### Manipulating Items

The world of Norrath is an abundant world full of items you can pick up, buy, sell, use or transform. When your character is "born," you already have several items - a basic weapon, some food and water, a book, and a scroll or two. (Items vary slightly, depending on your occupation.)

Before long, you'll acquire some valuables. Eventually, you'll want to buy containers to store your items, or put items in a bank deposit box for safekeeping.

Some items on your person can't be dropped, sold or traded (such as your milk flask and starting weapon). To remove these items from inventory, you must either store them in a bank or destroy them.

#### Viewing Your Inventory

Inventory management is an indispensable skill. If you're a pack rat, you'll constantly need to reassess what you're carrying and figure out what to do with the items you've accumulated.

**To see what's in your inventory, follow these steps:**
1. Click **Persona** to see your general inventory slots.
2. Click **Inventory**, or click the picture of your character. This toggles a second inventory window that shows weapons and coins you're carrying. You can click this button again to hide the second window.

> **Tip:** You can access your Persona and Inventory windows by programming them onto a button. See Hot Buttons.

The detailed view of your inventory is divided into several sections. You can place specific items on different parts of your body - hands, fingers, feet, etc.

**Eight general inventory slots** show all items in your possession that aren't coins or weapons you're holding. (Stored weapons do show up, however.) These slots are not location-specific. Use these slots to store items that you aren't wearing, as well as coins and weapons that aren't in use.

For certain items, you can stack more than one of that item in a single slot. The small number in the corner of the slot indicates how many items of that type are stacked.

**The coin window** shows how many platinum, gold, silver and copper coins you have. (See Money Matters for details.) Coins can be stacked, and there's no limit to how many you can carry. If you're trading with another player or depositing/withdrawing funds at a bank, click on a coin slot to display a slider. Use the slider to control how many coins you're fishing out of your coin purse.

**Location slots** show what items you're currently wearing on specific parts of your body, as well as weapons you're holding. The slots are named for easy reference. Some slots are listed twice, with a faint "1" and "2" behind the label. These special slots accommodate similar items on both the left and right sides of the body. When something is in a slot, you'll see a small picture of it in the slot.

#### Holding and Wearing Items

Just because you've stored something in a general inventory slot doesn't mean it's in use. If you want to hold a weapon or wear a new item of armor or clothing, you've got to move it to the right location slot:

1. Click on an item in a general inventory slot.
2. Once the item is floating on your cursor, click on an appropriate location slot.

Use this same click-and-drop method to take off a wearable item or store a weapon.

#### Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items

You can pick up items you find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped, traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form of a small, brown bag.

**To drop an item to the ground:**
1. Click on the item you don't want in your general inventory slot.
2. Once it floats on your cursor, click anywhere in your front view. Dropped items turn into brown bags.

**To permanently destroy an item:**
1. Click on the item you wish to destroy.
2. Once it floats on your cursor, click **Destroy**.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm.

**To pick up an item from the ground:**
1. Double-click on the bag.
2. Once its contents "stick" to your cursor, click on one of your general inventory slots.

#### Buying/Selling Items (NPC Merchants)

Whether you're new to EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and drink.

Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player, see Giving/Trading Items.

**To buy/sell an item with a merchant:**
1. Right-click on the merchant. This opens inventory windows for both you and the merchant.
2. To buy an item, click on something in the merchant's inventory window.
3. To sell an item, click on something in your inventory window. The shopkeeper provides an instant bid.
4. Click **Purchase** or **Sell**. Coins automatically change hands.

If you're selling multiple items of the same type, click the arrows on the slider window to control the number you're selling. You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the `Control` key while clicking the Sell or Purchase button. To buy or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the `Shift` key while clicking the Sell or Purchase button.

#### Giving/Trading Items (Player Characters)

You sometimes find that you desperately need (or don't want) a particular item. Or, you might be miles away from the nearest merchant. In these cases, you can turn to other players for support. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves through the Trade window.

In this screen, you can give away items that you own, or offer items and/or coins to other player characters. No transaction is final until both players agree to it.

**To give away/trade an item to another player:**
1. Open your Inventory screen and select the item.
2. Click on the recipient to "drop" the item into that person's inventory.
3. When the trade window opens, click **Trade**.

Both players must click Trade to complete the action. If either player puts another item into the trade bin after one player clicks Trade, he/she will have to click the button again.

If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). Beware, items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items, and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing quests that give items as rewards.

#### Inspecting Another Player's Inventory

To see if other players have something you might want to trade for, click on their characters. This targets them and, if you're standing close enough to them, opens their Inventory window. See Giving/Trading Items (above) to learn how to trade.

#### Inspecting an Item

You can view properties for most items by right-click-and-holding. You can do this in your inventory, a merchant's inventory, the trade window, bank window, and more. What information you can see depends on the item, but usually includes weight, occupations and races that can use it, weapon damage and speed, etc.

#### Auctioning Items

As you advance in the game, you'll find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your jewelry-making kit. Or, you could desperately need a spell ingredient yourself - the old adage "one man's trash is another man's treasure" holds true in EverQuest as well.

Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in your playing zone can hear. Unlike "/shout" (which is reserved for critical situations), "/auction" is only used for buying and selling items. The preferred usage is "WTB" (want to buy) or "WTS" (want to sell), followed by a description of the item.

Auction is better than trading because all players can see what you have or what you're looking for. In trading, you can only talk to people in your immediate vicinity or go around inspecting other players' inventories.

**To auction an item:**
1. Type "/auction" followed by "WTB" or "WTS", then a short item description.
2. When someone responds, set up a place to meet.
3. Meet the buyer and initiate a trade.

#### Containers and Banks

You've only got eight general inventory slots, several of which are nearly always occupied by food and drink. Some items can be stacked on top of one another in a single slot, such as fish, bread and arrows. Other items take up an entire slot. All add weight to your character (see your Stats window for limits). If you don't want to continually sacrifice one item for another, try purchasing a container or finding a bank.

**Containers**

Purchase backpacks, bags and other containers to increase your carrying capacity. By placing items inside a container, you can fit multiple possessions into a single slot. To open a container, double-click on it.

Certain containers also serve as catalysts for creating items - for instance, you need a bowl to make bread, and a medicine bag to mix potions.

**Banks**

Banks will gladly store coins for you, and they're also a great way to store inventory items. They're similar to containers in that you can store items in safe deposit boxes. Banks in Norrath are well-connected - even if you travel abroad, any banker can instantly conjure up your items. You've got eight bank inventory slots at your disposal. If you go to another bank, you don't get additional slots.

**To put an item in the bank:**
1. Find a bank and right-click on the banker. Eight bank inventory slots appear for you to use.
2. Click on an item in your inventory (it "floats" on your cursor).
3. Click on a bank inventory slot.

To withdraw an item from a bank, reverse the steps above.

#### What if You Die?

If you've worked long and hard, don't worry. Dying won't strip you of your possessions or coins - as long as your body is recoverable. (For example, don't drown at the bottom of an aqueduct - it may be a difficult task to find that exact spot and resurface without dying again.)

To reclaim what's rightfully yours, locate your body, right-click on it, and put the items into your new inventory (see Picking Up/Dropping Items).

> **Note:** If you're a new player (under Level 5) and you don't have much experience or many possessions yet, dying is sometimes the easiest way to replenish your foodstuffs. When resurrected, you'll have 5 milk and 5 bread, enough for several days traveling. And since your corpse probably doesn't have anything really valuable, you don't necessarily have to go reclaim your possessions.

#### Giving Permission to Drag Corpses

You can give someone permission to drag your corpse. Type in "/consent <player name>". This is useful if you die while adventuring in a group. One of your party can pick up your corpse and drag it to a safer and/or closer spot in the same zone.

### Eating and Drinking

Bread, milk and water are staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items, along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with 5 milk units (in a milk pouch) and 5 pieces of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time).

When you're running low on either item, your text display shows "You are low on food and drink." If you don't eat or drink soon, you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health and stamina suffer.

Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and other items. (See Buying/Selling Items). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement skills and agility.

**To eat/drink an item:**
1. View your inventory.
2. Right-click on the item you wish to consume.

Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used as needed. Other items (like a short beer) require that you physically consume them. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it.

**Foraging.** If you're an Iksar or you chose a nature-based occupation, you may possess a skill called Foraging. This enables you to find food in the wilderness, but it must be practiced just like any other skill.

**Dying.** If you're under Experience Level 5, letting yourself die is the easiest way to restock your food supplies. You'll lose a little bit of experience, and it may take longer to progress to the next level, but you'll at least have 5 milk and 5 bread.

---

### Money Matters

As a new character, you don't have any money. You'll spend most of your early playing sessions earning money to buy food, drink and items for your chosen occupation. You can earn money either through looting the corpses of small animals you've killed and selling those items. Occasionally, you may find a more experienced player who is willing to donate a few coins to your cause.

There are four denominations of coins in Norrath - platinum, gold, silver and copper. The exchange rate is 10 coins for each higher-value coin:

- 1 platinum = 10 gold
- 1 gold = 10 silver
- 1 silver = 10 copper

## 4 • Skills and Combat

A key part of building a successful EverQuest character is developing your skills. Skills describe abilities or trades that can be improved with practice. Depending on what occupation and race you chose, you possess certain innate skills.

From the start, all characters know a few basic skills - Beg, Fish, Sense Heading and Bind Wounds. Some skills come more easily to certain races or occupations. Other skills can be improved as you gain experience and training.

**To view your ranking in each skill:**
1. Click **Persona** (or the animated picture below the button).
2. Click **Skills** (if it's not already selected).

Before you can use a skill, you must program it onto an Ability Macro button:
1. Click **Abilities**, then right-click on a Macro button.
2. Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.

The Skills area of the screen shows your current proficiency in each skill. Initially, you'll be ranked as "Awful" in everything. The skill divisions are: Awful / Feeble / Very Bad / Bad / Below Average / Average / Good / Very Good / Excellent / Master. It takes 10 skill points to get to each next higher skill ranking.

Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master".

If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your skill.

To use a skill, simply click on that Macro button. (You can also put skills onto Hot Buttons.)

### Improving Skills and Training

The more you use a skill, the better you become at it. When you improve a skill ranking, a message appears in your Text Display. As long as you know the basics of a skill, it will improve the more you use it. Skill rankings are tied to your experience level - you can only improve a skill so much at Experience Level 1, improve it a bit more at Level 2, more at Level 3, and so on.

You can develop as many skills as you like - there's no limit. Some skills, however, are better suited for certain races, occupations or experience levels.

One good way to increase your proficiency in a certain skill is to visit a trainer. Trainers are usually masters of certain skills, and are willing to teach you. As a new player, you can visit your Guild hall and spend practice points, or credits toward training. Later, you'll have to pay for lessons.

**To approach a trainer:**
1. Visit your Guild hall.
2. Right-click on the Guild Master or a trainer.
3. The skill page pops up - click on the skill you wish to improve.
4. Click **Practice**.

Some skills can't be practiced until you reach a certain experience level. For these, you'll need to practice at least once to learn the basics of that skill.

#### Putting Skills on Macro Buttons

It's sometimes convenient to program a skill onto a Macro button. When you've done this, you simply click that button to use the skill:

1. Click **Abilities**, then right-click on a Macro button.
2. Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.
3. After that, just click that Macro button to use the skill.

#### Trade Skills

With a trade skill, you can make certain items by assembling the necessary pieces. Some trade skills require you to seek out a merchant and buy a book or kit specific to that skill. Others (like Fishing) only require you to purchase the proper equipment.

Before you can learn most skills, you must visit a merchant that specializes in that trade. He or she will sell you a book that outlines the basics for a certain skill. Once you've read it and acquired the necessary kit, component or ingredients, you can make pottery, bows and arrows, bread products and more.

**To make an item, you need all of the ingredients and the right kind of container:**
1. Right-click on the container (a small window opens).
2. Click on the needed items in your inventory, and click on an empty slot in the container.
3. Click **Combine**.

If you're lucky, you'll succeed in your creation, and a new item will show up in your inventory. Keep in mind that you'll occasionally fail, losing all items in the container.

---

### Experience Levels

You always begin as a Level 1 character. As you gain experience in the world (mostly through combat), you progress to the next level. At higher experience levels, you can improve many types of skills and add to your spellcasting abilities.

The best way to gain experience is to go out into the wilderness and kill creatures within your ability. You can also gain experience by completing quests and killing certain NPCs. At first, you'll need to take on rats, snakes and other small animals. Once their corpses quit yielding loot, it's probably time to move on to something larger.

You can tell whether or not killing a certain creature will give you experience by the color of its text response when you Consider it. Stay away from creatures with red text (too hard). Look instead for green responses (easy kill) and blue ones (you'll have the upper hand). See Before You Attack, for a list of the Consider response colors and what they mean.

#### Experience Bar

You can keep track of your experience and view your current experience level in the Persona screen. Even though your text display sends you a message each time you advance a level, it's a good idea to occasionally check your stats and level status.

**To view your current stats, experience level and progress towards the next level:**
1. Click **Persona** (or the animated picture below the button).
2. Click **Stats** (if it's not already selected).

The blue line in the middle of the experience bar is a magnification of one of the five graduated lines (bubbles). This way, you can see more accurately your progress towards your next level.

#### Party Experience

If you band with a party, it's sometimes easier to gain experience. (Parties earn experience the same way as an individual character does.) Three people hacking away at a Kobold or a Gnoll scout are much more effective than trying to take one on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent, points are split among the group members according to experience levels. The higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.

---

### Weapons

In EverQuest, you can fight using short-range melee weapons (swords, clubs and so forth), ranged weapons (bow and arrow), or your bare hands. If you've got magical spells, you can use those in combat as well - see Using Magic. Combat is not permitted inside any city. If you initiate an attack, the guards immediately come to kill you.

#### Acquiring Weapons

Nearly all occupations give you a basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you do, you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure you hang onto your original weapon throughout the game - even a basic sword isn't cheap, and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along the way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons.

> **Tip:** If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait, you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.

#### Weapon Types

You start out with a basic weapon, but as you progress in levels and earn more money, you'll want to upgrade. Even those who specialize in magic usually carry a formidable weapon in case their mana supply becomes depleted.

You can make four basic types of weapon attacks, each of which requires an appropriate weapon. All except for ranged attacks are melee (close combat) attacks. Some weapons are one-handed, meaning that you only need one hand to wield them. If you possess the Dual Wield skill, you can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and use them simultaneously during combat. Two-Handed weapons require both hands and a two-handed combat skill.

**Blunt.** Bashing damage delivered by a dull weapon (bruises your opponent).

**Slash.** Heavy, slicing damage delivered by a sharp, edged weapon or a whip (cuts your opponent).

**Piercing.** Stabbing damage from a small edged or pointed weapon (pierces your opponent).

**Ranged.** Piercing damage delivered from a distance by a propelled weapon, such as a bow and arrow.

With some skills you can deliver manual attacks during combat, such as a Kick or Bash. This adds to whatever weapon damage you dish out. The drawback, however, is that you must program these skills to a Macro or Hot button and press it whenever you want to use that attack.

**Weapon Examples:**

| 1-Hand Slash | 2-Hand Slash | 1-Hand Blunt | 2-Hand Blunt | 1-Hand Pierce | Ranged |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Axe | Bastard Sword | Club | Great Staff | Dagger | Bow |
| Battle Axe | Claymore | Hammer | Halberd | Dirk | Crossbow |
| Broad Sword | Great Sword | Mace | Scythe | Rapier | Longbow |
| Long Sword | Two-Handed Sword | Morning Star | Spear | Short Sword | Shortbow |
| Rapier | | Staff | | Stiletto | |
| Scimitar | | War Hammer | | | |
| Short Sword | | | | | |

#### Attacking with Weapons

You can fight manually in EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target, you can simply press `A` (or whichever key you've remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A` | Initiate auto-attack (on current target) |
| `Esc` | Release current target |

> **IMPORTANT!** Make sure you don't accidentally target an unintended NPC while auto-attack is on - the NPC may turn on you.

If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Macro or Hot button:
1. Click **Abilities**, then click on a Weapon skill.
2. Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot).
3. If you've programmed the skill onto a Hot button, you don't need to open the Abilities window first.

During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your text window that says "Your target is too far away." Be sure to remain facing your target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow. Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them.

The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage, you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent is an automatic function of your physical strength and weapon skills; so is your ability to evade blows.

#### Before You Attack

Prior to fighting, run through a quick, mental checklist:

1. Scribe and memorize any offensive spells you possess.
2. Program your Combat skills and spells (if any) to Macro buttons.
3. Identify your auto-attack hot key.
4. Put your weapon in hand:
   - Open your Inventory (press `I`) and click on your weapon.
   - Click on the picture of your character to put it in hand. (You only have to do this once per fight.)
   - Press `I` again or click **Done**.
5. Target a character, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing `F7` to target the nearest player or `F8` to target the nearest non-player character.
6. Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target):

| Text Color | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Green text | You're all but certain to defeat this opponent |
| Blue text | You'll most likely win the encounter |
| White text | An iffy gamble, but you could win |
| Yellow text | You should probably leave this opponent alone |
| Red text | You'll most likely die |

#### Developing Weapon Skills

Several things affect whether you get weapon-based combat skills, and whether you can accumulate more later.

**Occupation.** Depending on what occupation you choose, you may already possess one or more weapon skills. Most classes with warrior abilities (Warrior, Paladin, Barbarian and so forth) give you one or more from the very start.

**Experience.** You usually gain additional fighting skills as you progress through experience levels.

**Practice.** You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve your weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game with spendable practice credits. Later, you can pay for quick tutoring sessions. (Right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill you want to practice.) Some skills can only be practiced if you've reached a certain experience level.

---

### Using Magic

Those who cast magic are initially more vulnerable than other types of characters. Physical abilities are sacrificed for mental prowess, but eventually, most spell casters become feared and revered citizens of Norrath. Building a life as a Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric or Necromancer is more difficult than pursuing other occupations, but the rewards can be great....

#### Spell Book and Mana

All spell casters carry a spell book. You can open the book at any time by clicking the book icon on the left side of the screen. Once you copy a spell from a scroll (scribe it), it is permanently recorded in your book.

You can "memorize" eight scribed spells at any one time by placing them in a spell gem slot. Casting the spell then becomes as easy as clicking on its gem.

Spell casting consumes mana, a mystical source of magical energy. Like hit points, mana regenerates over time. To view your current level of mana, check the blue mana bar. (It shows the number of available mana points). The longer the blue line in the bar, the more mana you currently possess. As you gain experience levels, you gain additional mana. If you rest long enough or receive a mana boost, it rises to its full capacity.

#### Acquiring Spells

Some occupations (such as a Paladin) have one or more spells that are simply skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells, however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spell book and memorize it before you can cast it.

You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some special quests can also yield spells.

#### Spell Types

EverQuest has literally hundreds of spells that you can acquire and cast at various levels of experience. They're far too numerous to list here, but for the most part they can be classified into three types:

**Offensive.** Spells that are, or add punch to, combat attacks. Examples are Shock of Frost, Burst of Flame and Enfeeblement.

**Defensive.** Spells that boost armor ratings or give added protection or advantage during battle - for instance, Courage, Skin Like Wood and Invisibility to Undead.

**Healing.** Spells that restore health and stamina, like Minor Healing, Cure Disease, Endure Poison and Mend Bones.

**Other.** Spells that are neither offensive nor defensive. For example, you can cast Calm, Sense Magic, Summon Food and Bind Affinity. None of these spells is harmful or helpful in a combat situation, but they each have a specific purpose and provide some benefit.

#### Learning a Spell

If you've got a spell listed in your Skills window, you don't need to learn it. You simply program the skill onto a Macro button and click the button to cast it. Before you can cast a scroll-based spell, however, you have to copy it into your book and learn it.

**To learn a spell from a scroll:**
1. Click **Spells** (or click on the picture of your spell book).
2. Click on a spell scroll in your inventory. (To view a scroll's contents, right-click on it.)
3. Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe the spell.

A timer appears below the right-hand page, measuring how long it takes to scribe the spell. You only need to do this step once for any spell. Once it's recorded, it's permanently in your book.

Now, memorize the spell and add it to a spell gem slot (you must do this before you can cast it):
1. Click on the picture of the learned spell in your spell book. A rock-colored gem appears on your cursor.
2. Click on an oval slot to the left of your spell book.
3. A timer appears below the left-hand page, measuring how long it takes to memorize the spell. When you have memorized it, the gem turns colored.

You can memorize up to eight spells at any one time. To "forget" a spell (remove its gem), right-click on its gem slot. You can then memorize a different spell in the free slot. (If you can't remember which spell gem goes with which spell, hold down the `Alt` key.)

#### Spell Gem Colors

The spell gem colors in the Spell screen interface describe a particular spell's effects. Some spells can only be cast on yourself, on a particular type of target, or in a general area.

| Color | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Yellow | You can only cast it on yourself |
| Red | You can cast it on your current target |
| Green | The spell affects anyone close to your target |
| Blue | The spell has no range, and will radiate out from you |
| Orange | The spell only summons items and doesn't affect anyone |
| Purple | You can cast it on everyone in your group |

#### Before You Cast a Spell

Prior to casting, make sure you're ready (especially in a combat situation):
1. Scribe all spells to your spell book and meditate (to memorize them).
2. Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost it.
3. Program your spells to Macro buttons.
4. Identify your auto-attack hot key.
5. (Optional) Cast an armor- or strength-boosting spell on yourself.
6. Target a character, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing `F7` to target the nearest player or `F8` to target the nearest non-player character.
7. Check your chances in combat (right-click to "consider" your target).

Keep in mind that even if you're outmatched, you may still be able to defeat an enemy with spells alone. Every occupation has advantages.

> **Note:** If someone casts a spell on you, a message appears in your text display. In some cases, a square spell icon displays in the upper right corner of your view. Right-click and hold on the spell icon, to find out the name of the spell.

#### Developing Magical Skills

Some skills relate directly to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, Meditate and Specialization. (See Skill Types, for a listing and definition of each skill type.) You gain some of these skills through experience, while you're born with others.

#### Meditating

You can decrease the amount of time it takes you to memorize a spell by Meditating. This helps speed up the process of scribing and memorizing spells. To meditate, you must first have the Meditate skill (all spell casting characters receive this skill at Level 4). The Meditate skill also helps replenish mana faster.

**To meditate:**
1. Sit down by clicking the **SIT** button.
2. Click Spells, then click the **Meditate** button.

Meditating for long periods of time helps you regain mana faster, and is much more effective than meditating for short bursts. While meditating, you can hear everyone around you, but you can't type, move or perform any other actions.

#### Casting a Spell

**To cast a spell:**
1. Click on a target. (Spells that only affect the caster do not require a target.)
2. Left-click the icon in the oval slot.
3. Wait for your blue mana bar to return to normal, then cast again.

When you cast a spell, a time gauge shows up in the upper left corner, indicating how long it's going to take to cast that spell. If someone hits you or you take a step, casting may be interrupted. Improving your Channeling skill helps you recover from these situations, but you usually can't use this skill until you're a high-level caster.

Some spells are linked directly to certain skills - for example, Abjuration, Divination and Evocation. The better you are at that skill, the more chance your spell has of succeeding. If your casting fails, you'll see a message in the text display indicating that your spell "fizzled." Failed spells still consume mana, but don't produce any effects. Even if your casting is successful, your opponent may be able to resist that spell. Generally, higher-level characters are better at resisting spells cast by lower-level characters.

#### First-Level Spells

If you've chosen a magical occupation, you can cast certain spells as a beginner. As you gain experience levels, you can learn more advanced spells.

Here are some of the spells you can learn at Level 1 of each magical occupation:

| Occupation | Spell 1 | Spell 2 |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Cleric | Minor Healing | Courage |
| Druid | Minor Healing | Skin Like Wood |
| Enchanter | Minor Shielding | Shallow Breath |
| Magician | Minor Shielding | Burst of Flame |
| Necromancer | Minor Shielding | Life Tap |
| Shaman | Minor Healing | Inner Fire |
| Wizard | Minor Shielding | Shock of Frost |

### Looting a Vanquished Foe

Once you've killed something, you can check its corpse for useful items. Many things you recover from dead creatures are valuable items that you can sell to merchants or other players.

**To loot a corpse:**
1. Right-click on the corpse.
2. Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It "floats" on your cursor.
3. Click on a free slot in your inventory.

---

### Taunting

If you have the Taunt skill programmed to a Macro or Hot button, you can use it to draw a creature's attention away from whomever it's attacking. When you successfully taunt a monster, it turns and starts attacking you instead. You'll find that taunting is an indispensable group skill, especially if you want to keep the spell casters in your group alive.

**To taunt a creature:**
1. Click on the creature to target it.
2. Press **Taunt**.

---

### Combat Damage

Whenever your opponent hits you with either a weapon or spell, you take damage and your health is depleted. Keep an eye on your blue health bar - if it falls below 1/3, you may want to consider retreating until you're healed.

> **Tip:** If your party includes a spell caster, that character can spend his or her time casting healing and boosting spells on the others while they fight.

---

### Luring (Zones and Guards)

A well-known tip among EverQuest players is to lure monsters into a "safer" area and fight them there. A ranged attack can often draw a creature toward you. Try to fight near a zone boundary, or near a guard. If you get into trouble and need a quick solution, you can simply run toward either one. Creatures won't follow you across a zone boundary, and they're likely to forget about you after a few minutes. At that point, you can return to the previous zone. (You'll know you've changed zones whenever "Loading..." appears on your text display.)

Guards immediately kill unfriendly creatures if they come too close. Luckily, most creatures aren't intelligent enough to figure this out and tend to run headlong into sure death.

---

### Retreating

If you do decide that retreating is your best option, look for the safest escape route. Sometimes, you can run over to other players in the area, and someone will help attack the monster or taunt him away. Or, a spell caster might conveniently cast a spell in your direction, intentionally or unintentionally - if you run within range of an area spell, it affects you, too.

Zones and guards (as mentioned in the previous section) can also help save your life.

---

### Dueling

Even if you're not in a player-killing community, you can still challenge someone to a duel outside of a city. (The guards do not permit fighting inside.) Once you start a duel, it continues until one player defeats the other, or one player leaves the zone. Only player characters can duel.

**To start a duel:**
1. Target the player you want to duel.
2. Type `/d` and press `Enter`.

To accept a duel, your target must follow these same steps.

Dying during a duel is similar to dying in any other manner - see Health, Damage and Dying.

> **Note:** For non-player-killers, participating in a duel doesn't give the winner the right to loot the loser's corpse.

### Using Pets

Some occupations let you develop the ability to summon undead pets or elemental forces, or to befriend wild animals which aid you in combat. You'll have to find the correct spell for your class and purchase it before you can summon or charm a pet. Look for spells that begin with "Summon," "Befriend," "Charm," or that contain the word "Animal" or "Undead." A variety of pet-related spells also exist that you can use to heal your pet or boost its abilities.

Once you have a pet, you can instruct it to taunt your target, attack, follow you, guard a location, or protect you as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/pet as you were` | Put the pet at ease (cancels all previous orders) |
| `/pet attack` | Tell pet to attack designated target |
| `/pet back off` | Tell pet to stop attacking |
| `/pet follow me` | Tell pet to follow you (deactivates once you cross playing zones) |
| `/pet get lost` | Order a pet to kill itself |
| `/pet guard here` | Tell pet to guard its current location (it will attack all players and NPCs) |
| `/pet guard me` | Tell pet to attack anyone that attacks you, or that you attack |
| `/pet report health` | View pet's current health (% remaining) |
| `/pet taunt` | Tell pet to taunt your current target (toggles on/off) |
| `/pet who the leader` | View pet's commander (useful for enchanters) |

### Fighting Other Players

If you want to fight other players, you can do so by changing your character's status to that of a "player-killer." Player-versus-player (PvP) combat is an advanced part of playing EverQuest. We strongly suggest that you play for a while as a normal character in order to learn the game. Once you've mastered the basics, it's much easier to survive as a player-killer.

Player-killing is much more dangerous than normal gameplay - although you can't ever really die (your character just regenerates in or near your starting city), other players can loot your corpse. This means you're always at risk of losing your coins (Tallon, Vallon and Sullon Zek), or coins and one item (Rallos Zek server).

Most player-killers band together in guilds and focus on fighting other guilds, rather than participating in random encounters with other players. Therefore, doing a little research at the outset is often the best way to decide which guild to join. See Participating in Guilds, for more guild information.

**To become a player-killer:**
1. Find a Priest of Discord.
2. Open your inventory and click on the Tome of Order and Discord book. (Each character has this book at the start of the game. If you destroy it, that character can't become a player-killer.)
3. Give the book to the Priest.

By turning over the book, you permanently abandon all Order and follow Chaos instead. Once you've done this, you're marked as a player-killer. You can now kill other player-killers and loot their corpses, and they can kill you, providing they are fond of you. Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.

> **Note:** You can duel other players without becoming a player-killer. See Dueling.

#### Where You Can Fight Other Players

You can fight anywhere outside the city's gates, or in arenas within the city. The arena zones are clearly marked in your text display when you enter them.

If you attack another player in the city, the guards immediately attack and kill you.

#### PvP Servers

Several servers have been created specifically for player-vs-player (PvP) combat. Currently, there are four - Rallos Zek, Sullon Zek, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek.

#### Tips for New PvP Players

Here are a few tips to get you started:

- Don't join a PvP server for your first player-killing experience. If you play on a regular server, you can at least seek out safety inside the city gates and practice skills or simply rest.
- Learn your way around. It's easy to get lost in EverQuest - which is exactly what you don't want to do in times of crisis.
- Find friends you can trust. Other newbies you meet can make great allies in the future.
- Find a guild to join. Remember, there's strength in numbers.
- Use the Anonymous option (see Game Options: General). The less other players know about you, the better.
- Keep moving. Running is always better than walking, and you can often run away from someone or something that's chasing you.
- Make it a habit to target and consider (`/con`) everyone you run across.
- Use banks to store anything valuable. Likewise, buy bags - no one can loot items in them.
- On Sullon Zek, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek, you lose your coins on your character to an opponent if he or she kills you. On Rallos Zek, you lose your coins, plus one item in your inventory. (Items in bags and equipped weapons and shields cannot be looted).

### Health, Damage and Dying

To monitor health, check the red health bar. It monitors your current number of available hit points. The longer the bar, the healthier you are. With experience, you can take more damage.

To see how many hit points you currently possess, click **Stats** and look for "HP." A reading of 30/54 means that you currently have 30 out of 54 possible points. If you rest long enough or are magically healed, it rises to 54/54.

If you're hit with a weapon or an offensive spell, you lose hit points. Falling from heights or contracting diseases also lowers your health. The easiest way to restore health is to rest. If you're in mid-combat, run for safety. Health also restores when you drink a health potion, or someone casts Lay Hands on you.

#### Dying and Resurrecting

If you take enough damage, your health bar falls to zero and you die. You can't really die - your character falls unconscious and regenerates near your starting city. The worst part of dying is that you lose some experience, and you must find your body to reclaim any inventory.

#### Binding

Normally, your regeneration point is near your starting city. Binding resets your regeneration point to wherever you're standing. Find a magically inclined player to bind you to a new location when you travel. Otherwise, if you die, you'll resurrect back in your original city, no matter how far away you were when you were killed.

#### Reclaiming Items

When you die, your corpse is "locked." No one else can take what's in your inventory. The only trick is that you have a limited amount of time in which to find your body and transfer items to your inventory.

> **Note:** Corpse decay rates vary by your character's level, by whether or not you're logged into the game, and by whether or not you're carrying any items.

## 5 • Advanced Interface

This section describes advanced interface functions, including views, game options and Hot buttons.

### Camera Views

During gameplay, you can view your character from several different camera angles, zoom in and out, or pan up and down. You can also hide some or all of the interface.

To cycle between available views, press **View**, or press `F9`.

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| First-person view (default) | View straight ahead (you can't see your character) |
| Overhead (rotating) | View from above (camera rotates as you turn) |
| Rear (rotating) | View from rear (camera rotates as you turn and stays behind you) |
| Overhead (fixed) | View from above (camera does not rotate when you turn) |
| Rear (fixed) | View from rear (camera does not rotate when you turn) |

To cycle through interface views, press `F10`.

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Regular | Shows all interface elements |
| Partial | Makes some interface elements transparent |
| Hidden | Hides all interface elements |

### Hot Buttons

To make any interface button accessible at all times, there's a Hot button bank to the left of the screen with six different sets of six blank buttons. (The arrows cycle you through each set.) This means that you can program up to 60 Hot buttons (though you can only view 10 at once).

Hot button shortcuts are a good idea - you can copy any interface button function (any interface button, skill, spell, or Ability/Combat/Social/Main button) onto a blank Hot button.

**To add a Hot button:**
1. Click-and-hold on the button you want to copy.
2. Wait for a floating button to appear on your cursor (about 2 seconds).
3. Click on a blank Hot button slot.

**To remove a Hot button:**
1. Click-and-hold on the Hot button you want to delete.
2. Wait for that Hot button to float on your cursor.
3. Click anywhere in your front view to "drop" the button.

You can cycle through the Hot button sets by clicking the arrows, or by pressing `Shift` + a number key (1-6).

You may want to consider placing the following actions on Hot buttons:
- Sit/Stand
- Run/Walk
- Combat skills you often use (Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, etc.)
- Spells you often use (any spell you've memorized)
- Skills you often use (Fishing, Lay Hands, etc.)
- Social actions you often use (such as "/shout")

### Panning and Zooming

You can pan the camera in different directions, either with the keyboard (press `Alt` + arrow keys) or by right-clicking the mouse. You can also zoom the camera view in or out. To pan with the mouse, right-click-and-drag in any direction. (This works in all views except for fixed overhead and rear views - in these, the mouse zooms the view in and out.)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F12` | Enable/disable mouse panning |
| Numpad `5` or `Home` | Re-center view |
| Numpad `8`, `2` or `Alt` + `↑`, `↓` | Pitch view up/down |
| Numpad `+`, `-` or `Page Up`, `Page Down` | Zoom view in/out |

### Game Options

You can alter some of the game's settings to customize your playing experience. The options are divided into five different categories - General, Display, Mouse, Keyboard and Chat Filter.

**To set game options:**
1. Click **Options**.

## 6 • Quests and Groups

### Finding Quests

Once you're fairly familiar with the game, you may be ready to take on a quest, or an adventure with a specific goal. Most quests offer some sort of reward.

**Ready-Made Quests.** Many non-player characters have small quests. The best way to find out what they are is to hail various NPCs and ask. Non-player characters have certain keywords marked in square brackets - for example, "I need some help with my [problem]." If you respond with a question that includes that keyword, you'll receive more information.

**Player-Created Quests.** Players can create their own quests and publicize them via chat boards, the Internet or the in-game message boards. Keep your eyes and ears open for any interesting opportunities.

**Miscellaneous Events.** Some of the more creative EverQuest players organize public events. These include advertised duels, weddings between characters, celebrations, and in some cases, even lotteries and contests.

### Participating in Parties

Adventuring outside the city can be dangerous. Joining a party can help you defeat monsters that you normally can't kill, carry items that won't fit into your inventory, and progress through levels faster than you would alone. Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging.

When starting a party, consider the skills of each member that you invite. You want a good mixture of combat, spell-casting and healing abilities. At the very least, make sure you have a couple of strong fighters, a wizard, magician or enchanter to cast spells, and someone else with healing powers (like a cleric). Use variations of the "/who" command to see players of a certain level, race or occupation.

Parties are temporary groupings, as opposed to Guilds, which allow an ongoing affiliation between players.

#### Joining/Leaving/Disbanding a Party

You can either invite someone (of a similar experience level) to join your party, or accept an invitation from someone else who has started a party.

**To invite a player to join your party:**
1. Target the player.
2. Click **Main** (if those buttons aren't already displayed), then click **Invite**. You can also use `Ctrl`+`I` to invite someone into your party.

The player you're inviting receives the invitation on the text display, and his or her "Invite" button changes to "Follow."

**To accept a party invitation:**
1. Ask to join a party, or wait for someone to invite you to join.
2. Click **Main** (if those buttons aren't already displayed), then click **Follow**. (The button then reverts to "Invite.")

**To leave a party (or dissolve a party you started):**
- Click **Main** (if those buttons aren't already displayed), then click **Disband**.

Press `F1`-`F6` to target party members 1-6.

#### Party Notes

**Communication.** Keeping in touch with party members is crucial. Before combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle.

**Party Leader.** Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect someone to make decisions about important party matters.

**Party Health.** The names of fellow group members appear in the party member window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health status.

**Parties and Spells.** Some spells affect all members of a party. If you've got a magical member in your party, it might be a good idea to pitch in and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell.

**Parties and Experience.** Experience points are split between party members according to experience level - see Party Experience.

**Splitting Loot.** To split coin treasure evenly, enable AUTOSPLIT under Options/Gameplay. Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis.

### Participating in Guilds

Guilds take the basic idea behind forming parties a step further by making the group an official organization, complete with a charter, or a written set of intentions and purposes. Guilds allow players with similar ideas to form semi-permanent groups.

The reasons for joining a guild mirror some of the reasons for joining a group - you band together with other players who are interested in pursuing the same goals that you are. You develop friendly associations with other members. Furthermore, in a tight spot, fellow guild members are nearly certain to help you out. The focus generally isn't on adventuring together (though it can be). Instead, guild members share primary goals and concerns relating to life in Norrath.

Some guilds are run by non-player characters, but a group of players can also band together and form a new guild with a little planning. Hundreds of player-created guilds exist in EverQuest; finding the right one for your character can be a difficult task.

#### Guild Leaders

For most occupations, your first task as a new player is to find the proper non-player guild for your occupation and meet its leader. When you hand over the right scroll, you form a lasting association with a group and agree to abide by its charter.

Player-created guilds have a leader (usually the creator) who invites other players to join. As the group grows larger, he or she can create officers to help manage the guild.

The best way to locate a guild leader for a guild you want to join is to ask other players. Search out another member and find out the best time and location to contact the guild leader.

#### Joining/Leaving a Guild

Before you join a player-created guild, find out whether the guild's plans are similar to those of your character. Most guilds have a web site that lists their charter, goals and requirements. To join a non-player guild specific to your occupation, give the correct scroll to the guild master. To join a player guild, find the Guild Leader and ask to join. You're not obligated to accept a guild invitation, and player guilds aren't obligated to invite you.

Once you join a guild, you assume the same last name as other members of your guild. This name appears in <brackets> after your character's name onscreen. Your guild affiliation is also revealed when someone uses the "/who" command.

You can leave a guild at any time by typing: `/guildremove <your character's name>`

#### Creating a Player Guild

As time passes, you may decide that no existing guild suits your needs. In that case, you can solicit a group of players, draw up a charter and form your own guild.

**To form a new player guild:**
1. Gather up 10 players (including yourself).
2. Draw up a charter describing the guild's intentions and planned role.
3. Start EverQuest and click Chat to connect to the chat server. (All interested players should do this as well.)
4. (Leader only) Type in "#makeguild" to create a private chat channel.
5. Type in a name for the channel (top line; make it similar to the guild name) and a description of the guild (bottom line).
6. All charter members connect to the chat channel.
7. (Leader only) Click "Create Guild" to finalize the guild's creation.

Your guild appears in the list as "Submitted." Wait for your guild information to be reviewed. If Game Masters determine that you need to edit your charter, the guild is marked as "Revised."

Once your guild is approved, you'll receive an e-mail with further instructions. Your next step is to petition a GM (/petition) between the hours of 2 p.m. and 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time to complete the creation of the guild.

#### Guild Halls

Each city has quite a few guild halls for non-player (NPC) guilds. This is usually where you'll find the guild leader and trainers.

#### Guild Wars

It's very common for guilds to declare war on one another. The leader of any guild can declare war on another player guild, or call for a truce. The duration of the war can be set anywhere from 1 to 14 days. During this time, members of the warring guilds challenge one another to duels. The winner gets the loser's coins, plus one item from the loser's inventory. No experience is lost during a guild duel.

**Guild leaders declare war as follows:**
1. The leaders of both guilds arrange a time and location to meet away from the city and guards.
2. Each leader sends the other a "/guildwar <name> <duration>" message. (Replace the information in brackets with the name of the opposing guild and the duration of the war in days, from 1 to 14.)
3. This starts the war. Members of either guild may now attack one another, regardless of their player-killer status.

The war ends when time expires, or if both leaders send a "/guildpeace" message to the opposing guild.

#### Guild Commands

Guild leaders and members can send special "/" chat commands to others in their guild:

| Command | Action | Who Can Use |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/guildinvite <player name>` | Invite someone to join the guild | Leader only |
| `/guildinvite <player name> o` | Make someone an officer in the guild | Leader or officer |
| `/guildremove <player name>` | Remove a guild member | Any member can remove himself; only leader can remove others |
| `/guilddelete` | Disband the entire guild | Leader only |
| `/guildstatus <player name>` | View a character's rank within his guild | Any guild member |
| `/guildleader <player name>` | Appoint a new leader for the guild | Leader only |
| `/guildsay` | Send a message to all members of the guild | Guild members |
| `/guildwar <opposing guild leader's name> <duration>` | Declare war against another guild | Both guild leaders |
| `/guildpeace <opposing guild leader's name>` | Call a truce and end a guild war early | Both guild leaders |

> **Note:** In order for a guild leader to make an officer, the player must not be in the guild when using `/guildinvite o <playername>`. If a guild leader wants to promote someone to officer, simply have the player to be promoted target themselves and type `/guildremove` in order to be ready to be promoted to officer.

## 7 • The World Around You

Norrath is a wild and exciting place for the adventurous, but dangerous and ill-suited for the timid. You can uncover many cities, dungeons, forests and unexplored wilderness in your travels, but you'll need a good guide. While the maps in this section don't show all the details of the world, they should be enough to start you on your journey.

### Traveling

Several modes of transportation exist in the world. Walking is the most obvious, but not necessarily the safest. If you live near the water, the easiest way to travel may be by boat. For a talented few, teleporting is an available option.

**Walking.** If you decide to walk to another city, follow the path out of your home city's entrance. These paths are interconnected and will lead you to other places. Some even have signposts to help you find your way. When walking, it's a good idea to find trustworthy fellow travelers - just in case. Also, traveling at night can be difficult, so you may want to pick up a fire beetle eye or other light-producing item to illuminate the way.

**Traveling by Boat.** Boats are the free public transportation system of the game. To take a voyage, find a pier and wait. When a boat arrives, simply walk onto it. Like a subway, boats have a preset route that they follow. If you don't know where it's going, wait for another player to show up and ask them if they know its destination.

**Teleporting.** Experienced spellcasters and their companions may be able to magically teleport (travel instantaneously) from one point to another. Once they have gained a little experience, Clerics, Druids, Enchanters, Necromancers, Shamans and Wizards are able to learn the Gate spell, which teleports them back to their city of origin. To set the Gate destination to a new place, they must learn and cast Bind Affinity, another relatively low-level spell.

As they become more advanced, Wizards and Druids can learn to teleport themselves (and sometimes their party) to certain magic-rich outposts of the ancient Combine Empire (Wizards) or Marker Stones (Druids). Experienced Clerics can learn to teleport dead companions back to their corpses with the Revive, Resuscitate and Resurrection spells.

**Visiting other Planes.** Rumors abound concerning the existence of alternate planes of reality - the Planes of Air, Fear and Hate. Some travelers claim that high-level Wizards can transport you between planes.

### Need Help?

There may be times during play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention. During these times, your best bet is to turn to EverQuest's battalion of Game Masters.

GMs are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Game Masters is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience without the hindrance of unforeseen problems.

### Contacting a Game Master

To seek help, type `/petition`, followed by a brief message. Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, GMs may be swamped responding to other players' calls. Your petition is received and noted as soon as you send it, and a GM will help you as soon as he or she can.

When you are contacted, explain your situation. The GM will ask for more information if necessary. You can help the GM by conducting yourself in a calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant details.

**Special Game Master Commands:**
- `/petition` - Speak to a Game Master
- `/who gm all` - View list of all Game Masters who are currently in the game
