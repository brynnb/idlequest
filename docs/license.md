# License

Similar to ProgressQuest, this project falls under fair use because it transforms elements of the original EverQuest game for a different purpose—an idle game experience rather than an active MMORPG. It does not replicate the gameplay mechanics or experience in a 1:1 manner but instead serves as a commentary and nostalgic parody of EverQuest's legacy, which fits within the definition of transformative use. Additionally, IdleQuest is non-commercial, and the use of EverQuest's content is limited and for purposes that add new meaning, context, and value.

This project uses images from the "EverQuest Atlas: The Maps Of Myrist" book from 2001, created by Ryan Barker and Amanda Flock, and published by Sony (SOE).

Many game elements and assets are owned by Daybreak Game Company LLC. This project has no affiliation with them and probably no one else either.

This project uses a slightly modified [very cool dice library](https://github.com/sarahRosannaBusch/dice) which also has its own credits to previous works.

This project includes code licensed under the MIT License, which I'm including here because I think it's what I'm supposed to do? This license applies to the distributed and modified code in applicable libraries and not this project as a whole. I am unclear on which license to use for this project, or if I can use one at all.
