would be a bad idea . Dragons would kill me if I entered the
shrine they had built on the other side of the forest . That is if I
made it that far, since there was always the chance that the for-
est creatures would decide to have me for lunch .
     When I asked Tolan w hat he was going to do, he said he
would be staying there for a time as a guest. He was a grown
man; I assume he knew his own business. Not wanting to over-
stay my welcome , I took Tolan's advice and said goodbye . I went
back through the giant city (still no sign of Breen), across the
wastes , and eventual ly, back to the shores of the lceclad Ocean,
where I sit now.
     I' m going to head back out again soon to look for Breen,
Solist, and the others. I wou ldn't feel right abandoning them at
this point, and besides , it could turn out to be profitable .

THE WORLD AROUND You
Norrath is a wild and exciting place for the adventurous, but dangerous and
ill-suited for the timid . You can uncover many cities, dungeons, forests and
unexplored wilderness in your travels, but you ' ll need a good guide . While the
maps in this section don 't show all the details of the world , they should be
enough to start you on your journey.

'lraveling
Several modes of transportation exist in the world . Walking is the most obvious,
but not necessarily the safest. If you live near the water, the easiest way to travel
may be by boat. For a talented few, teleporting is an available option.

Walking. If you decide to walk to another city, follow the path out of your
home city' s entrance. These paths are interconnected and wi ll lead you to
other places. Some even have signposts to help you find your way. When
walking, it's a good idea to find trustwort hy fellow travelers - just in case.
Also, traveling at night can be difficult, so you may want to pick up a fire
beetle eye or other light-producing item to illuminate the way.

Traveling by Boat. Boats are the free public transportation system of the
game . To take a voyage , find a pier and wait. When a boat arrives, simply
walk onto it. Like a subway, boats have a preset route that they follow. If you
don 't know where it's going, wait for another player to show up and ask them
if they know its destination .
Teleporting. Experienced spel lcasters and their companions may be able to
magically teleport (travel instantaneously) from o ne point to a nother. Once
they have gained a little experience Clerics, Druids , Enchanters , Necromancers,
Shamans and Wizards are able to learn the Gate spell , which teleports them
back to their city of origin. To set the Gate destination to a new place, they
must learn and cast Bind Affinity, another relatively low-level spell.

As they become more advanced , Wizards and Druids can learn to teleport                  A.   The Great Wheel          H.    The Wall
