# Server Execution Policy

- **Never** attempt to run the server yourself (e.g., `go run main.go`, `npm run dev`, or starting any background service).
- If you need the server running to test changes or perform tasks, **stop and ask the USER** to run it for you.
- Do not attempt to kill or manage service processes unless explicitly directed by the USER.
